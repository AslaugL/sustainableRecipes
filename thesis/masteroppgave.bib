  abstract = {Globally, two billion people suffer from micronutrient deficiencies, 151 million children under five suffer from stunting, and millions more have impaired cognitive development related to poor nutrition. This is partly due to insufficient consumption of animal-sourced foods (ASF), which supply multiple bioavailable nutrients that are lacking in the cereal-based diets of the poor. Yet, reports like the one recently published by the EAT-Lancet Commission, solely focus on the threat of ASF consumption on sustainability and human health, overestimate and ignore the tremendous variability in the environmental impact of livestock production, and fail to adequately include the experience of marginalized women and children in low- and middle-income countries whose diets regularly lack the necessary nutrients. Yet animal-source foods have been described by the World Health Organization as the best source of high-quality nutrient-rich food for children aged 6\textendash 23 months. Livestock and ASF are vital to sustainability as they play a critical role in improving nutrition, reducing poverty, improving gender equity, improving livelihoods, increasing food security, and improving health. The nutritional needs of the world's poor, particularly women and children, must be considered in sustainability debates.},

  abstract = {Background: Suboptimal diet is an important preventable risk factor for non-communicable diseases (NCDs); however, its impact on the burden of NCDs has not been systematically evaluated. This study aimed to evaluate the consumption of major foods and nutrients across 195 countries and to quantify the impact of their suboptimal intake on NCD mortality and morbidity. Methods: By use of a comparative risk assessment approach, we estimated the proportion of disease-specific burden attributable to each dietary risk factor (also referred to as population attributable fraction)among adults aged 25 years or older. The main inputs to this analysis included the intake of each dietary factor, the effect size of the dietary factor on disease endpoint, and the level of intake associated with the lowest risk of mortality. Then, by use of disease-specific population attributable fractions, mortality, and disability-adjusted life-years (DALYs), we calculated the number of deaths and DALYs attributable to diet for each disease outcome. Findings: In 2017, 11 million (95\% uncertainty interval [UI]10\textendash 12)deaths and 255 million (234\textendash 274)DALYs were attributable to dietary risk factors. High intake of sodium (3 million [1\textendash 5]deaths and 70 million [34\textendash 118]DALYs), low intake of whole grains (3 million [2\textendash 4]deaths and 82 million [59\textendash 109]DALYs), and low intake of fruits (2 million [1\textendash 4]deaths and 65 million [41\textendash 92]DALYs)were the leading dietary risk factors for deaths and DALYs globally and in many countries. Dietary data were from mixed sources and were not available for all countries, increasing the statistical uncertainty of our estimates. Interpretation: This study provides a comprehensive picture of the potential impact of suboptimal diet on NCD mortality and morbidity, highlighting the need for improving diet across nations. Our findings will inform implementation of evidence-based dietary interventions and provide a platform for evaluation of their impact on human health annually.

The traditional role of agriculture in producing food and generating income is fundamental, but the entire food system-from inputs and production, through processing, storage, transport and retailing, to consumption-can contribute much more to the eradication of malnutrition. Agricultural policies and research must continue to support productivity growth for staple foods while paying greater attention to nutrient-dense foods and more sustainable production systems. Traditional and modern supply chains can enhance the availability of a variety of nutritious foods and reduce nutrient waste and losses. Governments, international organizations, the private sector and civil society can help consumers choose healthier diets, reduce waste and contribute to more sustainable use of resources by providing clear, accurate information and ensuring access to diverse and nutritious foods.},

  abstract = {Objectives: Nutrient profiling (NP) models, underpinning front-of-pack (FOP) labelling, can guide consumers towards healthier food choices and should be aligned with food-based dietary guidelines. In France, [the FSAm/HCSP NP model], underpinning the Nutri-Score (NS) FOP, ranks foods on both nutrients-to-limit (saturated fat, sodium, sugar) and nutrients-to-encourage (e.g., protein, fibre, fruits, vegetables, legumes and nuts) and was found to adequately align with dietary recommendations in Europe. However, investigations on the comparable ranking of foods by the FSAm/HCSP NP model with the new Canadian dietary guidelines is lacking. The objective was to assess the ability of the NS to discriminate the nutritional quality of foods and beverages in the Canadian food supply and their consistency with nutritional recommendations according to the Canada's 2019 Food Guidelines (CFG). Methods: Using the University of Toronto Food Label Information Program 2017 database (n = 17,360), the nutritional scores for prepackaged foods and beverages were derived using the NS. These scores correspond to five grades of nutritional quality, ranging from green (A; highest quality) to red (E; lowest quality). Scores were assessed as binary where A/B were considered 'in alignment' with CFG recommendations while C/D/E were considered 'not in alignment'. Results: The NS system classified 21\% of products as A, ranging from 99\% of legumes to 0.45\% of the sugars/sweets. The NS was able to discriminate the nutritional quality of foods within the same food groups (based on display of three grades represented within the Nutri-Score). Overall, there was 73\% agreement between NS and CFG, ranging from 48\% for combination dishes to 95\% for eggs/egg substitute categories. The classification of foods according to the NS was consistent with the CFG; foods for which consumption is recommended were more favourably classified (e.g., 76\% of vegetables were classified as A or B) than foods for which consumption should be limited (e.g., 79\% of snacks were classified as C/D/E). Conclusions: The NS FOP system is an effective tool to discriminate products across and within food categories. The classification of different food groups in the NS displayed a high consistency with the new Canadian dietary guidelines.},

This study aims at characterizing gaps between the QDGs and usual dietary and lifestyle patterns in Qatar, identifying demographic and socioeconomic determinants of adherence to the QDGs and investigating the association between adherence and cardiometabolic risk. Methods: This study is based on the Qatar National STEPwise cross-sectional survey which was conducted on a nationally representative sample of Qatari adults, aged 18 to 64 years (n = 1109). Data collection included socio-demographic characteristics, lifestyle factors, anthropometric (weight, height and waist circumference (WC)), and blood pressure measurements. The dietary intake of participants was evaluated using a non-quantitative food frequency questionnaire (FFQ). Biochemical assessment was performed to measure the fasting levels of blood sugar, triglycerides (TG) and HDL cholesterol. The metabolic syndrome (MetS) was defined as the presence of three or more cardiometabolic risk factors. To examine adherence to the guidelines, each specifc recommendation was matched to corresponding data drawn from the survey. To investigate the association of sociodemographic, lifestyle and cardiometabolic characteristics with adherence to the QDGs, an adherence score was calculated. Results: More than 83\% of adults did not meet the recommendations for vegetables, fruits, whole grains, legumes and high fibre intakes, 70\% were overweight or obese, 50-72\% reported frequent consumption of sweetened beverages and sweets, and 47\% reported frequent consumption of fast foods. Younger adults, the unemployed, the least educated and those not married had lower adherence to the QDGs. Adherence was inversely associated with elevated WC (OR: 0.88, 95\% CI:0.82-0.95) and the MetS (OR:0.84,95\% CI:0.74-0.96). Conclusions: Building on the identified gaps and vulnerable population groups, the study findings should provide a road map for the prioritization of interventions and the development of culture- specific programs aiming at promoting adherence to dietary guidelines in Qatar, while serving as a model to other countries in the region.},

  abstract = {The prevalence of iron deficiency anemia is highest among low and middle-income countries. Millets, including sorghum, are a traditional staple in many of these countries and are known to be rich in iron. However, a wide variation in the iron composition of millets has been reported, which needs to be understood in consonance with its bioavailability and roles in reducing anemia. This systematic review and meta-analysis were carried out to analyze the scientific evidence on the bioavailability of iron in different types of millets, processing, and the impact of millet-based food on iron status and anemia. The results indicated that iron levels in the millets used to study iron bioavailability (both in vivo and in vitro) and efficacy varied with the type and variety from 2 mg/100 g to 8 mg/100 g. However, not all the efficacy studies indicated the iron levels in the millets. There were 30 research studies, including 22 human interventions and 8 in vitro studies, included in the meta-analysis which all discussed various outcomes such as hemoglobin level, serum ferritin level, and absorbed iron. The studies included finger millet, pearl millet, teff and sorghum, or a mixture of millets. The results of 19 studies conducted on anaemic individuals showed that there was a significant (p \textexclamdown{} 0.01) increase in hemoglobin levels by 13.2\% following regular consumption (21 days to 4.5 years) of millets either as a meal or drink compared with regular diets where there was only 2.7\% increase. Seven studies on adolescents showed increases in hemoglobin levels from 10.8 {$\pm$} 1.4 (moderate anemia) to 12.2 {$\pm$} 1.5 g/dl (normal). Two studies conducted on humans demonstrated that consumption of a pearl millet-based meal significantly increased the bioavailable iron (p \textexclamdown{} 0.01), with the percentage of bioavailability being 7.5 {$\pm$} 1.6, and provided bioavailable iron of 1 {$\pm$} 0.4 mg. Four studies conducted on humans showed significant increases in ferritin level (p \textexclamdown{} 0.05) up to 54.7\%. Eight in-vitro studies showed that traditional processing methods such as fermentation and germination can improve bioavailable iron significantly (p \textexclamdown{} 0.01) by 3.4 and 2.2 times and contributed to 143 and 95\% of the physiological requirement of women, respectively.

  abstract = {Background: Vegan diets, where animal- and all their by-products are excluded from the diet, have gained popularity, especially in the last decade. However, the evaluation of this type of diet has not been well addressed in the scientific literature. This study aimed to investigate the adequacy of vegan diets in European populations and of their macro- and micronutrient intakes compared to World Health Organization recommendations. Methods: A systematic search in PubMed, Web of Science, IBSS, Cochrane library and Google Scholar was conducted and 48 studies (12 cohorts and 36 cross-sectional) were included. Results: Regarding macronutrients, vegan diets are lower in protein intake compared with all other diet types. Veganism is also associated with low intake of vitamins B2, Niacin (B3), B12, D, iodine, zinc, calcium, potassium, selenium. Vitamin B12 intake among vegans is significantly lower (0.24\textendash 0.49 {$\mu$}g, recommendations are 2.4 {$\mu$}g) and calcium intake in the majority of vegans was below recommendations (750 mg/d). No significant differences in fat intake were observed. Vegan diets are not related to deficiencies in vitamins A, B1, {$B$}6, C, E, iron, phosphorus, magnesium, copper and folate and have a low glycemic load. Conclusions: Following a vegan diet may result in deficiencies in micronutrients (vitamin B12, zinc, calcium and selenium) which should not be disregarded. However, low micro- and macronutrient intakes are not always associated with health impairments. Individuals who consume a vegan diet should be aware of the risk of potential dietary deficiencies.},

Methods: A representative sample of the Belgian population was randomly selected from the National Population Register following a multistage stratified sampling procedure. Information on dietary intake was collected from 3146 subjects between 3 and 64 year old through two non-consecutive 24-hour dietary recalls using GloboDiet\textregistered. In addition, a self-administered food frequency questionnaire was completed. The distribution of habitual food consumptions and proportion of persons who did not meet the recommendations were estimated with SPADE. Results: For most of food groups analysed, the habitual consumption did not comply with FBDG. The consumption of nutrient-poor and energy-dense foods (e.g. alcohol, soft drinks and snacks) was excessive (35\% of total energy intake), while the consumption of most other food groups was below the minimum recommended. A large majority of the population had an inadequate consumption of dairy products (98\%), vegetables (95\%), fruit (91\%), potatoes, rice and pasta (88\%) bread and cereals (83\%) and water and sugar-free drinks (73\%). Males had higher consumption of most food groups than females, thereby complying more often with FBDG. For all food groups, except dairy products and fruit, the consumption increased with age. The proportion of individuals meeting FBDG was the highest among young children (3-5 years) and the worst among adolescents aged 14-17 years old. Habitual consumption remained stable between 2004 and 2014 in the population aged 15-64 years old for all food groups except for increased consumption of water and sugar-free drinks (1180 to 1289 g/d) and decreased consumption of spreadable and cooking fat (27 to 19 g/d), red meat (34 to 25 g/d) and bread and cereals (173 to 142 g/d). Conclusions: The habitual food consumption of the Belgian population (3-64 years) in 2014-2015 deviates largely from FBDG, particularly among adolescents aged between 14 and 17 years old. Few improvements were observed between 2004 and 2014 in the population between 15 and 64 years old. Further efforts are therefore necessary to improve dietary habits in Belgium, in order to prevent and reduce diet-related diseases.},

A different approach to problems of multiple significance testing is presented. It calls for controlling the expected proportion of falsely rejected hypotheses- the false discovery rate. This error rate is equivalent to the FWER when all hypotheses are true but is smaller otherwise. Therefore, in problems where the control of the false discovery rate rather than that of the FWER is desired, there is potential for a gain in power. A simple sequential Bonferronitype procedure is proved to control the false discovery rate for independent test statistics, and a simulation study shows that the gain in power is substantial. The use of the new procedure and the appropriateness of the criterion are illustrated with examples.},

  abstract = {\textemdash{} Biodiversity loss is accelerating around the world. The global rate of species extinction today is orders of magnitude higher than the average rate over the past 10 million years. \textemdash{} The global food system is the primary driver of this trend. Over the past 50 years, the conversion of natural ecosystems for crop production or pasture has been the principal cause of habitat loss, in turn reducing biodiversity. \textemdash{} Ourfoodsystemhasbeenshapedoverpastdecadesbythe`cheaperfood'paradigm. Policies and economic structures have aimed to produce ever more food at ever lower cost. Intensified agricultural production degrades soils and ecosystems, driving down the productive capacity of land and necessitating even more intensive food production to keep pace with demand. Growing global consumption of cheaper calories and resource-intensive foods aggravates these pressures. \textemdash{} Current food production depends heavily on the use of inputs such as fertilizer, pesticides, energy, land and water, and on unsustainable practices such as monocropping and heavy tilling. This has reduced the variety of landscapes and habitats, threatening or destroying the breeding, feeding and/or nesting of birds, mammals, insects and microbial organisms, and crowding out many native plant species. \textemdash{} As a major contributor to global greenhouse gas emissions, our food system is also driving climate change, which further degrades habitats and causes species to disperse to new locations. In turn, this brings new species into contact and competition with each other, and creates new opportunities for the emergence of infectious disease. \textemdash{} Without reform of our food system, biodiversity loss will continue to accelerate. Further destruction of ecosystems and habitats will threaten our ability to sustain human populations. Reform will rely on the use of three principal levers: \textemdash{} Firstly, global dietary patterns need to converge around diets based more on plants, owing to the disproportionate impact of animal farming on biodiversity, land use and the environment. Such a shift would also benefit the dietary health of populations around the world, and help reduce the risk of pandemics. Global food waste must be reduced significantly. Together, these measures would reduce pressure on resources including land, through reducing demand. \textemdash{} Secondly, more land needs to be protected and set aside for nature. The protection of land from conversion or exploitation is the most effective way of preserving biodiversity, so we need to avoid converting land for 2 Chatham House Food system impacts on biodiversity loss Three levers for food system transformation in support of nature agriculture. Restoring native ecosystems on spared agricultural land offers the opportunity to increase biodiversity. \textemdash{} Thirdly, we need to farm in a more nature-friendly, biodiversity-supporting way, limiting the use of inputs and replacing monoculture with polyculture farming practices. \textemdash{} These three levers are in part interdependent. Most notably, the protection and setting aside of land for nature and the shift to nature-friendly farming both depend on dietary change, and will become increasingly difficult to achieve if continued growth in food demand exerts ever-growing pressure on land resources. \textemdash{} The year ahead offers a potentially unique window of opportunity for food system redesign. A series of international summits and conferences will take place in 2021, during which the topic of food systems and biodiversity will be a common thread. Importantly, the UN secretary-general will convene the world's first UN Food Systems Summit (UNFSS) in recognition of the need for a transformation of the food system to improve nutrition security, public health and environmental sustainability. \textemdash{} In 2021, governments around the world are expected to unlock unprecedented levels of investment to support economic recovery from the COVID-19 pandemic. Efforts to set in motion a `green recovery' will bring questions of sustainability, equity and societal resilience to the fore, creating new opportunities for joined-up policymaking that affords equal priority to public and planetary health. \textemdash{} In light of these opportunities, this paper recommends action on three fronts if efforts to establish a biodiversity-supporting food system are to be advanced in 2021: \textemdash{} International decision-makers need to recognize the interdependence of supply-side and demand-side action. Dietary change and a reduction in food waste are critical to breaking the system lock-ins that have driven the intensification of agriculture and the continued conversion of native ecosystems to crop production and pasture. \textemdash{} Stakeholders leading on the design and delivery of the UNFSS must ensure that it embeds a `food systems approach' across other key international processes, including UN climate negotiations. The summit should aim to bring together the interdependent policy threads of environmental sustainability, inclusive prosperity, sustainable growth, and improved public health and well-being. \textemdash{} Internationalandnationaldecision-makersneedtostrengthenthecoherence between global agreements and national-level action. National dialogues are needed to translate global commitments into action on the ground. At the same time, national accounting frameworks will be key to building understanding of the value of biodiversity, and to supporting biodiversity protection. Global guidelines in policy areas such as responsible investment, dietary change and nature-based climate change mitigation solutions will be needed to guide national-level action plans that can collectively deliver transformative change to the global food system.},

  abstract = {Objective: Dietary habits developed during childhood and adolescence are likely to continue into adulthood. An unbalanced diet may cause nutrient deficiencies and excessive energy intake; these enhance the risk for developing overweight and obesity and their co-morbidities. In the present analysis, food consumption of adolescents is described and evaluated against German food-based dietary guidelines with special focus on socio-economic status (SES) and region of residence. Design: Within the 'German Health Interview and Examination Survey for Children and Adolescents' (KiGGS Wave 2), the cross-sectional 'Eating Study as a KiGGS Module' (EsKiMo II) was conducted from 2015 until 2017 to provide data about dietary behaviour. Setting: Germany. Participants: 1353 adolescents aged 12-17 years from a nationwide representative sample with food consumption data from computer-assisted dietary history interviews. Results: The median consumption of fruits, vegetables, starchy foods and milk/dairy products among adolescents in Germany was below the recommendation. The median consumption of both meat/meat products and unfavourable foods, like confectionery, which should be consumed sparingly, was about 1.5 times the recommended amount. The total amount of beverages consumed by most adolescents was above the minimum amount recommended. Soft drink consumption of adolescents with a low SES was three to five times higher than soft drink consumption of adolescents with a high SES. Conclusions: The results indicate the need for an improvement of dietary habits among adolescents in Germany. Further approaches to promote healthy diets in Germany should be continued, and the focus on social inequalities should be strengthened.},

  abstract = {Objective: To derive healthy and sustainable food-based dietary guidelines (FBDG) for different target groups in the Netherlands and describe the process. Design: Optimised dietary patterns for children, adolescents, adults and the elderly were calculated using an optimisation model. Foods high in saturated and trans-fatty acids, salt and sugar, and low in dietary fibre, were excluded. The dietary patterns resembled the current food consumption as closely as possible, while simultaneously meeting recommendations for food groups, nutrients, maximum limits for foods with a high environmental impact, and within 85 \% of the energy requirement. Recommended daily amounts of food groups were based on the optimised dietary patterns and expert judgement. Setting: The Netherlands. Participants: FBDG were derived for Dutch people with different ages, genders, activity levels and food preferences. Results: For most target groups the optimisation model provided dietary patterns that complied with all requirements. For some food groups, the optimised amounts varied largely between target groups. For consistent messages to consumers, the optimised dietary patterns were adjusted to uniform recommendations per target group. Recommendations were visualised in the Wheel of Five. The advice is to eat the recommended amounts of foods according to the Wheel of Five and limit consumption of other foods. Conclusions: Based on an optimisation model, scientific evidence, information on dietary patterns and expert knowledge, we derived FBDG for different target groups. The Wheel of Five is a key food-counselling model that can help Dutch consumers to make their diets healthier and more environmentally sustainable.},

These dietary trends are commonly studied using longitudinal food consumption surveys. An alternative to studying changes in eating behaviour may be found in recipe analysis of traditional cookbooks. Few such studies exist, however, and it is unclear whether dietary trends over time can be identified this way. The present paper analyses full-meal recipes from a traditional Dutch cookbook between 1950 and 2010. The selected recipes show an increase in energy density. Additionally, the protein weight per kcal increased. In general, the observed trends are similar to those identified by the Dutch National Food Consumption Survey. The analysis therefore suggests that traditional cookbooks can be used as an indicator to identify dietary trends over time, although further studies are necessary to support this hypothesis.},

The present work (1) reviews the methods and processes (systematic approach/review, inclusion of public consultation) used to identify, select and grade the evidence underpinning the recommendations, particularly for total carbohydrate (CHO), fibre and sugar consumption, and (2) examines the extent to which variation in the methods and processes applied relates to any differences in the final recommendations. A search of WHO, US, Canada, Australia and European sources identified 19 documents from 13 authorities with the desired detailed information. Processes and methods applied to derive recommendations were compiled and compared. (1) A relatively high total CHO and fibre intake and limited intake of (added or free) sugars are generally recommended. (2) Even where recommendations are similar, the specific justifications for quantitative/qualitative recommendations differ across authorities. (3) Differences in recommendations mainly arise from differences in the underlying definitions of CHO exposure and classifications, the degree to which specific CHO-providing foods and food components were considered, and the choice and number of health outcomes selected. (4) Differences in the selection of source material, time frames or data aggregation and grading methods appeared to have minor influence. Despite general consistency, apparent differences among the recommendations of different authorities would likely be minimized by: (1) More explicit quantitative justifications for numerical recommendations and communication of uncertainty, and (2) greater international harmonization, particularly in the underlying definitions of exposures and range of relevant nutrition-related outcomes.},

Methods: Nutritional composition of 7777 foods available on the French market collected from the web-based collaborative project Open Food Facts were retrieved. Distribution of products across the 5-CNL categories according to food groups, as arranged in supermarket shelves was assessed. Distribution of similar products from different brands in the 5-CNL categories was also assessed. Discriminating performance was considered as the number of color categories present in each food group. In the case of discrepancies between the category allocation and French nutritional recommendations, adaptations of the original score were proposed. Results: Overall, the distribution of foodstuffs in the 5-CNL categories was consistent with French recommendations: 95.4 \% of 'Fruits and vegetables', 72.5 \% of 'Cereals and potatoes' were classified as 'Green' or 'Yellow' whereas 86.0 \% of 'Sugary snacks' were classified as 'Pink' or 'Red'. Adaptations to the original FSA score computation model were necessary for beverages, added fats and cheese in order to be consistent with French official nutritional recommendations. Conclusion: The 5-CNL label displays a high performance in discriminating nutritional quality of foods across food groups, within a food group and for similar products from different brands. Adaptations from the original model were necessary to maintain consistency with French recommendations and high performance of the system.},

Throughout the years, researchers from different fields have proposed conceptual models addressing factors influencing the food choice, recognized as a key leverage to improve planetary and human health. However, a multidisciplinary approach is needed to better understand how different factors are involved and interact with each other in the decision-making process. The present paper reviews and analyzes existing models, providing an intact point-of-view by integrating key elements into a bigger framework. Key determinants of general food choice are identified and categorized, including food-internal factor (sensory and perceptual features), food-external factors (information, social environment, physical environment), personal-state factors (biological features and physiological needs, psychological components, habits and experiences), cognitive factors (knowledge and skills, attitude, liking and preference, anticipated consequences, and personal identity), as well as sociocultural factors (culture, economic variables, political elements). Moreover, possible directions of influence among the factors towards final food choice were discussed. The need of multidisciplinary impulses across research field with the support of empirical data are crucial for understanding factors influencing food choice as well as for enriching existing conceptual models. The framework proposed here would serve as a roadmap for facilitating communications and collaborations between research fields in a structural and systematic way.},

Objective: This study aims to explore the patterns of food ingredients and the nutritional content of recipes posted on Pinterest and to examine the factors associated with recipes that engage more users. Methods: Data were collected from Pinterest between June 28 and July 12, 2020 (207 recipes and 2818 comments). All samples were collected via 2 new user accounts with no search history. A codebook was developed with a raw agreement rate of 0.97 across all variables. Content analysis and natural language processing sentiment analysis techniques were employed. Results: Recipes using seafood or vegetables as the main ingredient had, on average, fewer calories and less sodium, sugar, and cholesterol than meat- or poultry-based recipes. For recipes using meat as the main ingredient, more than half of the energy was obtained from fat (277/490, 56.6\%). Although the most followed pinners tended to post recipes containing more poultry or seafood and less meat, recipes with higher fat content or providing more calories per serving were more popular, having more shared photos or videos and comments. The natural language processing\textendash based sentiment analysis suggested that Pinterest users weighted taste more heavily than complexity (225/2818, 8.0\%) and health (84/2828, 2.9\%). Conclusions: Although popular pinners tended to post recipes with more seafood or poultry or vegetables and less meat, recipes with higher fat and sugar content were more user-engaging, with more photo or video shares and comments. Data on Pinterest behaviors can inform the development and implementation of nutrition health interventions to promote healthy recipe sharing on social media platforms.},

Two 'contradictory information' conditions asked participants to read one news article on the risks of a low-carbohydrate diet and one article on the risks of a low-fat diet. Two 'convergent information' conditions asked participants to read two articles with similar information on the risks of one of these two diets. A fifth 'established health recommendations' control condition asked participants to read two articles on the harms of smoking and sun exposure. A sixth 'no information' condition served as a second control group. We used general linear models to test hypotheses on the effects of exposure on confusion, nutritional backlash and dietary intentions.Setting:USA.Participants:Adults (n 901) registered with Amazon's Mechanical Turk (M-Turk).Results:Exposure to contradictory information about carbohydrates and dietary fats increased confusion and nutritional backlash compared with exposure to established health recommendations for non-dietary behaviours and a no-exposure control. Exposure to contradictory information also increased confusion compared with exposure to consistent nutrition information regarding carbohydrates and dietary fats.Conclusions:Contradictory nutrition information in the news media can negatively affect consumers' attitudes, beliefs and behavioural intentions. Dietary debates that play out in the media may adversely influence both short-term dietary decisions and future efforts to communicate about unrelated nutrition issues.},

The motivation for completing the paper was the inadequate synthesis of food greenhouse gas emissions available in the public domain. The paper reviewed 369 published studies that provided 1718 global warming potential (GWP) values for 168 varieties of fresh produce. A meta-analysis of the LCA studies was completed for the following categories: fresh vegetables (root vegetables, brassica, leaves and stems); fresh fruits (pepo, hesperidium, true berries, pomes, aggregates fruits and drupes); staples (grains, legumes, nuts, seeds and rice); dairy (almond/coconut milk, soy milk, dairy milk, butter and cheese); non-ruminant livestock (chicken, fish, pork); and ruminant livestock (lamb and beef). The meta-analysis indicates a clear greenhouse gas hierarchy emerging across the food categories, with grains, fruit and vegetables having the lowest impact and meat from ruminants having the highest impact. The meta-analysis presents the median, mean, standard deviation, upper and lower quartile, minimum and maximum results for each food category. The resultant data enables streamline calculations of the global warming potential of human diets, and is illustrated by a short case study of an Australian family's weekly shop. The database is provided in the Appendix as a resource for practitioners. The paper concludes with recommendations for future LCA studies to focus upon with respect to content and approach.},

It responds to the lack of detailed data for many countries by providing sectoral contributions to food-system emissions that are essential for the design of effective mitigation actions. In 2015, food-system emissions amounted to 18 Gt CO2 equivalent per year globally, representing 34\% of total GHG emissions. The largest contribution came from agriculture and land use/land-use change activities (71\%), with the remaining were from supply chain activities: retail, transport, consumption, fuel production, waste management, industrial processes and packaging.

In this Primer, we introduce the principles of life cycle assessment (LCA), which allows for the assessment of the global extent of the inputs, outputs, and potential environmental impacts throughout the life cycle of a product system. We describe how LCA works following the standard phases of (1) goal and scope, (2) life cycle inventory, (3) life cycle impact assessment, and (4) interpretation. We show that LCA studies can capture the environmental impacts of foods, diets, and food production systems. While LCA has been expanding in scope and breadth, collaboration across disciplines is needed to further capture the diversity of food systems and to better deal with underassessed foods.},

  abstract = {Background: There is a tendency to report micronutrients intakes collectively for adults, with broad age ranges being used. This means that certain sub-population groups such as young adults are often overlooked. The objective of the present article was to derive and evaluate micronutrient intakes across UK adults in their twenties, thirties, forties and fifties. Methods: A secondary analysis of the UK National Diet and Nutrition Survey (years 1\textendash 6) was undertaken. Data from n = 3,238 adults was analyzed and micronutrient intakes from food sources (excluding supplements) derived as a percentage of the Reference Nutrient Intake (RNI) and percentage below the Lower Reference Nutrient Intake (LRNI) for males and females aged 20\textendash 29, 30\textendash 39, 40\textendash 49, and 50\textendash 59 years. Mean intakes were used in instances where this data was unavailable (for vitamins D and E). Results: Sizeable gaps were found for magnesium with 19\% of young people in their twenties having intakes below the LRNI. Amongst UK females intakes of 9 micronutrients (riboflavin, vitamin B6, B12, folic acid, calcium, iron, magnesium, potassium, and iodine) were significantly lower than males aged 20\textendash 59 years (p \textexclamdown{} 0.001) expressed as a percentage of the RNI. Young adults in their twenties had significantly lower (p \textexclamdown{} 0.05) intakes of 8 micronutrients (vitamin A, riboflavin, folic acid, calcium, magnesium, potassium, iodine, and copper) expressed as a percentage of the RNI compared with adults in their thirties, forties and fifties. There were also considerable gaps in dietary selenium intakes with 50.3\% females and 25.8\% males having total intakes beneath the LRNI. A quarter of women had iron (25.3\%) and potassium (24.3\%) intakes below the LRNI. Conclusions: UK females and younger adults appear to be particularly vulnerable to micronutrient shortfalls from food sources alone. Clearly, improvements in dietary quality are needed across mid-life. Alongside this, fortification and supplementation strategies may be considered to help adults achieve dietary targets at this life-stage when they should be at their nutritional prime.},

  abstract = {Food blogs are an increasingly popular source of information about food and nutrition. There is a perception that foods published on clean eating blogs, which promote unprocessed foods, are healthier than comparable foods without these claims. However, foods with these claims and their nutrient composition have not previously been evaluated. The purpose of the study was to describe the nutritional content of clean eating recipes compared to recipes without clean eating claims and the nutritional guidelines published by the World Health Organisation (WHO). Clean eating recipes were systematically selected from 13 popular clean eating blogs and were described and compared with control recipes without clean eating claims. The nutrient profiles from the included recipes were summarised and evaluated against criteria from WHO recommendations for chronic disease prevention and criteria from the U.K. Food Standards Agency. Data for 86 clean eating recipes were extracted that represented five food categories: breakfast, snacks, treats, desserts, and smoothies. These were matched with 86 control recipes without clean eating claims. The clean eating recipes, per portion, provide the equivalent of 15\% of daily energy intake. The average serving sizes were not significantly different between clean eating and control recipes. Overall, the clean eating recipes contained significantly more protein (8.1 {$\pm$} 7.3 g vs. 5.7 {$\pm$} 4.1 g, p = 0.01), fat (15.8 {$\pm$} 10.6 g vs. 12.4 {$\pm$} 9.3 g, p = 0.03), and fibre (5.0 {$\pm$} 4.3 g vs. 2.8 {$\pm$} 2.9 g, p \textexclamdown{} 0.01) per serving than control recipes. There were no significant differences between clean eating and control recipes with respect to the energy (1280 {$\pm$} 714 kJ vs. 1137 {$\pm$} 600 kJ, p = 0.16), carbohydrate (31.5 {$\pm$} 27.3 g vs. 33.9 {$\pm$} 19.4 g, p = 0.51), sugar (21.1 {$\pm$} 20.9 g vs. 23.2 {$\pm$} 14.9 g, p = 0.46), and sodium content (196.7 {$\pm$} 269 vs. 155.8 {$\pm$} 160.8, p = 0.23). Less than 10\% of clean eating and control recipes met the WHO constraints for proportions of energy from fat and sugar intake. A simulated nutrient profile of an average clean and control recipe shows that nutrients for both are similarly classified as moderate to high in fat, saturated fat, salt, and sugar. Foods with clean eating claims contained the same amount of energy, sugar, and sodium as foods without those claims. Clean eating claims are potentially misleading for consumers who may believe these foods are healthy alternatives, potentially undermining people's efforts to eat a healthy diet.},

It is largely unknown, however, how individual foods or entire diets affect human health via poor air quality. We show how food production negatively impacts human health by increasing atmospheric fine particulate matter (PM2.5), and we identify ways to reduce these negative impacts of agriculture. We quantify the air quality-related health damages attributable to 95 agricultural commodities and 67 final food products, which encompass \textquestiondown 99\% of agricultural production in the United States. Agricultural production in the United States results in 17,900 annual air quality-related deaths, 15,900 of which are from food production. Of those, 80\% are attributable to animalbased foods, both directly fromanimal production and indirectly from growing animal feed. On-farm interventions can reduce PM2.5-related mortality by 50\%, including improved livestock waste management and fertilizer application practices that reduce emissions of ammonia, a secondary PM2.5precursor, and improved crop and animal production practices that reduce primary PM2.5emissions from tillage, field burning, livestock dust, and machinery. Dietary shifts toward more plant-based foods that maintain protein intake and other nutritional needs could reduce agricultural air quality-related mortality by 68 to 83\%. In sum, improved livestock and fertilization practices, and dietary shifts could greatly decrease the health impacts of agriculture caused by its contribution to reduced air quality.},

Participants reported demographic characteristics, home cooking frequency, and their use of 4 traditional resources for meal ideas (e.g., cookbooks), and 7 Internet-based resources for meal ideas (e.g., Pinterest) in an online survey. Independent samples t-tests compared home cooking frequency by resource use. Association rule learning identified those demographic characteristics that were significantly associated with resource use. Family and friends (71\%), food community websites (45\%), and cookbooks (41\%) were the most common resources reported. Cookbook users reported preparing more meals at home per week (M = 9.65, SD = 5.28) compared to non-cookbook users (M = 8.11, SD = 4.93; t = -3.55, p \textexclamdown{} 0.001).

However, its adaptability to multiple nutritional contexts in Europe requires further investigation. This study aimed to evaluate the applicability of the Nutri-Score in various European countries, regarding its ability to discriminate the nutritional quality of foods and its consistency with national dietary recommendations. The European Food Information Resource (EUROFIR) nutritional composition databases from eight European countries (Finland, France, Norway, Poland, Portugal, Slovakia, Sweden, and Switzerland) were used. The distribution of foods across the Nutri-Score classes within food groups was assessed, as well as the discriminating performance of the label, and the adequacy of nutritional recommendations. The Nutri-Score demonstrated high discriminating ability for all food groups, with similar trends in the eight countries, and consistency with nutritional recommendations. For instance, fruit and vegetable products were mainly classified in the two healthiest Nutri-Score categories, while sugar and animal fat products were mainly classified in the two less healthy categories of the Nutri-Score. Our results support the fact that the Nutri-Score would be a relevant tool to discriminate the nutritional quality of products within and across relevant food groups in different European countries, with consistency with nutritional recommendations.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: A carbon footprint is the sum of greenhouse gas emissions (GHGEs) associated with food production, processing, transporting, and retailing. OBJECTIVE: We examined the relation between the energy and nutrient content of foods and associated GHGEs as expressed as g CO2 equivalents. DESIGN: GHGE values, which were calculated and provided by a French supermarket chain, were merged with the Composition Nutritionnelle des Aliments (French food-composition table) nutrient-composition data for 483 foods and beverages from the French Agency for Food, Environmental and Occupational Health and Safety. Foods were aggregated into 34 food categories and 5 major food groups as follows: meat and meat products, milk and dairy products, frozen and processed fruit and vegetables, grains, and sweets. Energy density was expressed as kcal/100 g. Nutrient density was determined by using 2 alternative nutrient-density scores, each based on the sum of the percentage of daily values for 6 or 15 nutrients, respectively. The energy and nutrient densities of foods were linked to log-transformed GHGE values expressed per 100 g or 100 kcal. RESULTS: Grains and sweets had lowest GHGEs (per 100 g and 100 kcal) but had high energy density and a low nutrient content. The more-nutrient-dense animal products, including meat and dairy, had higher GHGE values per 100 g but much lower values per 100 kcal. In general, a higher nutrient density of foods was associated with higher GHGEs per 100 kcal, although the slopes of fitted lines varied for meat and dairy compared with fats and sweets. CONCLUSIONS: Considerations of the environmental impact of foods need to be linked to concerns about nutrient density and health. The point at which the higher carbon footprint of some nutrient-dense foods is offset by their higher nutritional value is a priority area for additional research.},

Aim: The aim of the study was to assess if the portion sizes measured in calories in Danish cookbook recipes have changed throughout the past 100 years. Methods: Portion size measured in calories was determined by content-analysis of 21 classic Danish recipes in 13 editions of the famous Danish cookbook ``Food'' from 1909 to 2009. Calorie content of the recipes was determined in standard nutritional software, and the changes in calories were examined by simple linear regression analyses. Results: Mean portion size in calories increased significantly by 21\% ({$\beta$} = 0.63; p \textexclamdown{} 0.01) over the past 100 years in the analyzed recipes. The mean portion size in calories from a composed homemade meal increased by 77\% ({$\beta$} = 2.88; p \textexclamdown{} 0.01). The mean portion size in calories from meat increased by 27\% ({$\beta$} = 0.85; p = 0.03), starchy products increased by 148\% ({$\beta$} = 1.28; p \textexclamdown{} 0.01), vegetables increased by 37\% ({$\beta$} = 0.21; p = 0.13) and sauce increased by 47\% ({$\beta$} = 0.56; p = 0.02) throughout the years. Conclusions: Portion sizes measured in calories in classical Danish recipes have increased significantly in the past 100 years and can be an important factor in increased energy intake and the risk of developing overweight and obesity.},

In the next step, we added fresh vegetables purchased by an urban hospital at the distribution center to analyze the city's food distribution system's environmental impact. The data used were obtained at the distribution center Nova Ceasa and at an urban hospital to complete the last stage of the food distribution, corresponding to 2019. The Global Warming Potential (GWP) impact values correlated with horticulture production were recovered from the literature related to open-field vegetable crops under similar agricultural conditions. We computed the quantity of vegetables produced on-field, the distances traveled, the on-road transportation fuel, and the environmental impact using the GWP calculator. The study found a wide range of GWP values. From the studies and analyzes, the results indicated that the impact of GWP is greater in the production phase in the field, followed by urban transport except for fresh tomatoes. The tomato results showed greater environmental impact in the transport of more distant products and smaller quantities. Results suggest that crop production and the long traveled distances are the main factors in the environmental impact. We also concluded that the greater the amount of product transported in a trip, the lower the environmental impact.},

  abstract = {Food systems (FS) encompass the entire range of actors and their interlinked value-adding activities involved in the production, aggregation, processing, distribution, consumption and disposal of food products that originate from agriculture, forestry or fisheries, and parts of the broader economic, societal and natural environments in which they are embedded. The food system is composed of subsystems (e.g. farming system, waste management system, input supply system, etc.) and interacts with other key systems (e.g. energy system, trade system, health system, etc.). Therefore, a structural change in the food system might originate from a change in another system; for example, a policy promoting more biofuel in the energy system will have a significant impact on the food system. A sustainable food system (SFS) is a food system that delivers food security and nutrition for all in such a way that the economic, social and environmental bases to generate food security and nutrition for future generations are not compromised. This means that:-It is profitable throughout (economic sustainability);-It has broad-based benefits for society (social sustainability); and-It has a positive or neutral impact on the natural environment (environmental sustainability). A sustainable food system lies at the heart of the United Nations' Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). Adopted in 2015, the SDGs call for major transformations in agriculture and food systems in order to end hunger, achieve food security and improve nutrition by 2030. To realize the SDGs, the global food system needs to be reshaped to be more productive, more inclusive of poor and marginalized populations, environmentally sustainable and resilient, and able to deliver healthy and nutritious diets to all. These are complex and systemic challenges that require the combination of interconnected actions at the local, national, regional and global levels. A food system must be considered in the context of rapid population growth, urbanization, growing wealth, changing consumption patterns, and globalization as well as climate change and the depletion of natural resources. The developments in food systems have yielded many positive results, especially over the past three decades in developing countries. These results include the expansion of off-farm employment opportunities as food industries have developed, and the widening of food choices beyond local staples, thus satisfying consumers' preferences in terms of taste, form and quality.},

  abstract = {Agriculture accounts for 92\% of the freshwater footprint of humanity; almost one third relates to animal products. In a recent global study, Mekonnen and Hoekstra (2012) [31] show that animal products have a large water footprint (WF) relative to crop products. We use the outcomes of that study to show general trends in the WFs of poultry, pork and beef. We observe three main factors driving the WF of meat: feed conversion efficiencies (feed amount per unit of meat obtained), feed composition and feed origin. Efficiency improves from grazing to mixed to industrial systems, because animals in industrial systems get more concentrated feed, move less, are bred to grow faster and slaughtered younger. This factor contributes to a general decrease in WFs from grazing to mixed to industrial systems. The second factor is feed composition, particularly the ratio of concentrates to roughages, which increases from grazing to mixed to industrial systems. Concentrates have larger WFs than roughages, so that this factor contributes to a WF increase, especially blue and grey WFs, from grazing and mixed to industrial systems. The third factor, the feed origin, is important because water use related to feed crop growing varies across and within regions. The overall resultant WF of meat depends on the relative importance of the three main determining factors. In general, beef has a larger total WF than pork, which in turn has a larger WF than poultry, but the average global blue and grey WFs are similar across the three meat products. When we consider grazing systems, the blue and grey water footprints of poultry and pork are greater than those for beef. \textcopyright{} 2013 The Authors.},

  abstract = {Sustainability considerations have been absent from most food security assessments conducted to date, despite the tremendous economic, environmental, and social implications of meeting accelerating food demand in the face of water shortages and climate change. In addition, previous food security work has generally focused only on achieving adequate calories, rather than addressing dietary diversity and micronutrient adequacy, both of which are critical to maintaining a healthy overall nutritional status. In response to the limitations of previous assessments, a new methodology is proposed here based on the concept of "sustainable nutrition security" (SNS). This novel assessment methodology is intended to remedy both kinds of deficiencies in the previous work by defining seven metrics, each based on a combination of multiple indicators, for use in characterizing sustainable nutrition outcomes of food systems: (1) food nutrient adequacy; (2) ecosystem stability; (3) food affordability and availability; (4) sociocultural wellbeing; (5) food safety; (6) resilience; and (7) waste and loss reduction. Each of the metrics comprises multiple indicators that are combined to derive an overall score (0-100). A novel SNS assessment methodology based on these metrics can be deployed by decision-makers and investors to set meaningful goals, track progress, and evaluate the potential impact of food system interventions intended to improve sustainability and human nutrition outcomes.},

  abstract = {Objective: Critical nutrition literacy (CNL), as an increasingly important area in public health nutrition, can be defined as the ability to critically analyse nutrition information, increase awareness and participate in action to address barriers to healthy eating behaviours. Far too little attention has been paid to establishing valid instruments for measuring CNL. The aim of the present study was to assess the appropriateness of utilizing the latent scales of a newly developed instrument assessing nursing students' 'engagement in dietary habits' (the 'engagement' scale) and their level of 'taking a critical stance towards nutrition claims and their sources' (the 'claims' scale). Design: Data were gathered by distributing a nineteen-item paper-and-pencil self-report questionnaire to university colleges offering nursing education. The study had a cross-sectional design using Rasch analysis. Data management and analysis were performed using the software packages RUMM2030 and SPSS version 20. Setting: School personnel handed out the questionnaires. Subjects Four hundred and seventy-three students at ten university colleges across Norway responded (52 \% response rate). Results Disordered thresholds were rescored, an under-discriminating item was discarded and one item showing uniform differential item functioning was split. The assumption of item locations being differentiated by stages was strengthened. The analyses demonstrated possible dimension violations of local independence in the 'claims' scale data and the 'engagement' scale could have been better targeted. Conclusions: The study demonstrates the usefulness of Rasch analysis in assessing the psychometric properties of scales developed to measure CNL. Qualitative research designs could further improve our understanding of CNL scales. \textcopyright{} The Authors 2013.},

  abstract = {Agricultural water requirements differ between foods. Population-level dietary preferences are therefore a major determinant of agricultural water use. The ``water footprint'' (WF) represents the volume of water consumed in the production of food items, separated by water source; blue WF represents ground and surface water use, and green WF represents rain water use. We systematically searched for published studies using the WF to assess the water use of diets. We used the available evidence to quantify the WF of diets in different countries, and grouped diets in patterns according to study definition. ``Average'' patterns equated to those currently consumed, whereas ``healthy'' patterns included those recommended in national dietary guidelines. We searched 7 online databases and identified 41 eligible studies that reported the dietary green WF, blue WF, or total WF (green plus blue) (1964 estimates for 176 countries). The available evidence suggests that, on average, European (170 estimates) and Oceanian (18 estimates) dietary patterns have the highest green WFs (median per capita: 2999 L/d and 2924 L/d, respectively), whereas Asian dietary patterns (98 estimates) have the highest blue WFs (median: 382 L/d per capita). Foods of animal origin are major contributors to the green WFs of diets, whereas cereals, fruits, nuts, and oils are major contributors to the blue WF of diets. ``Healthy'' dietary patterns (425 estimates) had green WFs that were 5.9\% (95\% CI: -7.7, -4.0) lower than those of ``average'' dietary patterns, but they did not differ in their blue WFs. Our review suggests that changes toward healthier diets could reduce total water use of agriculture, but would not affect blue water use. Rapid dietary change and increasing water security concerns underscore the need for a better understanding of the amount and type of water used in food production to make informed policy decisions.},

This review focuses on the impact of temperature, CO2, and ozone on agronomic crops and the implications for crop production. Understanding these implications for agricultural crops is critical for developing cropping systems resilient to stresses induced by climate change. There is variation among crops in their response to CO2, temperature, and precipitation changes and, with the regional diff erences in predicted climate, a situation is created in which the responses will be further complicated. For example, the temperature effects on soybean [Glycine max (L.) Merr.] could potentially cause yield reductions of 2.4\% in the South but an increase of 1.7\% in the Midwest. The frequency of years when temperatures exceed thresholds for damage during critical growth stages is likely to increase for some crops and regions. The increase in CO2 contributes signifi cantly to enhanced plant growth and improved water use effi ciency (WUE); however, there may be a downscaling of these positive impacts due to higher temperatures plants will experience during their growth cycle. A challenge is to understand the interactions of the changing climatic parameters because of the interactions among temperature, CO2, and precipitation on plant growth and development and also on the biotic stresses of weeds, insects, and diseases. Agronomists will have to consider the variations in temperature and precipitation as part of the production system if they are to ensure the food security required by an ever increasing population. \textcopyright{} 2011 by the American Society of Agronomy.},

Nutri-Score is a front-of-pack nutrition label with summary graded colour-coding, which aims to inform consumers, in a simple and understandable way, of the overall nutritional value of foods, in order to help them to make healthier choices at the point of purchase and to encourage manufacturers to improve the nutritional quality of their products. It is based on a five-colour scale (from dark green to dark orange) associated with letters, from A to E, to optimize logo accessibility and understanding by the consumer. Nutri-Score does not merely characterize foods as ``healthy'' or ``unhealthy''. Rather, the graded logo provides semi-quantitative information, depending on the colour/ letter, of the relative overall nutritional composition of a food product compared to other similar products as to whether it is more or less favourable to health. Nutri-Score is the only proposed labelling scheme that adheres entirely to the concepts and processes that were published by the World Health Organisation (WHO) Europe concerning the validation studies that are required to select and evaluate a front-of-pack nutrition label. The aim of the present paper is to present the scientific basis for the design of the Nutri-Score and to summarize the various studies to validate its calculation method and its graphic format. We explore its effectiveness and superiority compared to other labelling schemes that have been implemented in other countries or supported by pressure groups. The necessity for objective, impartial consideration of how best to use Nutri-Score and avoid misunderstandings is highlighted.},

Information was sourced from the FBDG repository of the FAO, which catalogs FBDG for all countries where they are available, including a description of the food guide (the graphic representation of the dietary guidelines), a set of key messages, and downloadable documents provided by the countries. FBDG are currently available for 90 countries globally: 7 in Africa, 17 in Asia and the Pacific, 33 in Europe, 27 in Latin America and the Caribbean, 4 in the Near East, and 2 in North America. The year of publication of current versions ranges from 1986 to 2017 (mean 2009). This review provides summaries of the key messages and food guides that are used to communicate national dietary guidance, organized by food group, and evaluates the extent to which each set of FBDG includes existing recommendations articulated by the WHO. Some guidance appears nearly universally across countries: to consume a variety of foods; to consume some foods in higher proportion than others; to consume fruits and vegetables, legumes, and animal-source foods; and to limit sugar, fat, and salt. Guidelines on dairy, red meat, fats and oils, and nuts are more variable. Although WHO global guidance encourages consumption of nuts, whole grains, and healthy fats, these messages are not universally echoed across countries. Future frontiers in FBDG development include the incorporation of environmental sustainability and increased attention to sociocultural factors including rapidly changing dietary trends. Steps toward regional and global dietary recommendations could be helpful for refinement of country-level FBDG, and for clear communication and measurement of diet quality both nationally and globally.},

Networks comprise graphical representations of the relationships (edges) between variables (nodes). Network analysis provides the capacity to estimate complex patterns of relationships and the network structure can be analysed to reveal core features of the network. This paper provides an overview of networks, how they can be visualised and analysed, and presents a simple example of how to conduct network analysis in R using data on the Theory Planned Behaviour (TPB)., Method: Participants (n\,=\,200) completed a TPB survey on regular exercise. The survey comprised items on attitudes, normative beliefs, perceived behavioural control, and intentions. Data were analysed to examine the network structure of the variables. The EBICglasso was applied to the partial correlation matrix., Results: The network structure reveals the variation in relationships between the items. The network split into three distinct communities of items. The affective attitude item was the central node in the network. However, replication of the network in larger samples to produce more stable and robust estimates of network indices is required., Conclusions: The reported network reveals that the affective attitudinal variable was the most important node in the network and therefore interventions could prioritise targeting changing the emotional responses to exercise. Network analysis offers the potential for insight into structural relations among core psychological processes to inform the health psychology science and practice.},

The aim of this study was to investigate the association between FVK and FVI in Australian adults and to identify subgroups most at risk of poor knowledge. Using data from the Australian Diabetes, Obesity, and Lifestyle Study (AusDiab), we investigated associations between FVK and FVI, as well as demographic and lifestyle factors. Baseline FVK was measured using two self-reported questions. FVI was assessed using a validated, self-reported, food frequency questionnaire in 1999/00 (baseline), 2004/05, and 2011/12. Amongst the 8966 participants assessed at baseline, 24.1\% had adequate, 73.0\% had insufficient, and 2.9\% had poor FVK. Using linear regression, those with insufficient or poor FVK reported significantly lower FVI (grams/day) compared to those with adequate FVK: baseline (coefficient (95\%CI)): -67.1 (-80.0, -54.3) and -124.0 (-142.9, -105.1), respectively, whilst, at 12 years, the differences were -42.5 (-54.6, -30.5) and -94.6 (-133.8, -55.5) grams/day, respectively (all p \textexclamdown{} 0.001). Poor FVK was more likely to be reported in males, older individuals (\textquestiondown 65 years), socio-economically disadvantaged, smokers, and those with insufficient physical activity/sedentary behavior. We demonstrate that having adequate knowledge of FVI, defined as knowing to consume fruit and vegetables several times a day for a well-balanced diet, is strongly associated with FVI, with several demographic and lifestyle factors predicting FVK. Health promotion messages aimed at increasing FVK should target these subgroups for maximal effect.},

Design: Cross sectional study. Setting: Three supermarkets with the largest share of the grocery market in the United Kingdom, 2010. Samples: 100 main meal recipes from five bestselling cookery books by UK television chefs and 100 own brand ready meals from the three leading UK supermarkets. Main outcome measures: Number of meals for which the nutritional content complied with WHO recommendations, and the proportion of nutrients classified as red, amber, or green using the UK FSA's "traffic light" system for labelling food. Results: No recipe or ready meal fully complied with the WHO recommendations. The ready meals were more likely to comply with the recommended proportions of energy derived from carbohydrate (18\% v 6\%, P=0.01) and sugars (83\% v 81\%, P=0.05) and fibre density (56\% v 14\% P\textexclamdown 0.01). The recipes were more likely to comply with the recommended sodium density (36\% v 4\%, P\textexclamdown 0.01), although salt used for seasoning was not assessed. The distributions of traffic light colours under the FSA's food labelling recommendations differed: the modal traffic light was red for the recipes (47\%) and green for ready meals (42\%). Overall, the recipes contained significantly more energy (2530 kJ v 2067 kJ), protein (37.5 g v 27.9 g), fat (27.1 g v 17.2 g), and saturated fat (9.2 g v 6.8 g; P\textexclamdown 0.01 for all) and significantly less fibre (3.3 g v 6.5 g, P\textexclamdown 0.01) per portion than the ready meals.

Typically, these diets are high in plant-sourced and low in animal-sourced and processed foods. Despite the fact that their environmental impacts vary, they are often referred to as 'sustainable diets'. Here we systematically review the available published evidence on the effect of 'sustainable diets' on environmental footprints and human health. Eight databases (OvidSP-Medline, OvidSP-Embase, EBSCO-GreenFILE, Web of Science Core Collection, Scopus, OvidSP-CAB-Abstracts, OvidSP-AGRIS, and OvidSP-Global Health) were searched to identify literature (published 1999-2019) reporting health effects and environmental footprints of 'sustainable diets'. Available evidence was mapped and pooled analysis was conducted by unique combinations of diet pattern, health and environmental outcome. Eighteen studies (412 measurements) met our inclusion criteria, distinguishing twelve non-mutually exclusive sustainable diet patterns, six environmental outcomes, and seven health outcomes. In 87\% of measurements (n = 151) positive health outcomes were reported from 'sustainable diets' (average relative health improvement: 4.09\% [95\% CI -0.10-8.29]) when comparing 'sustainable diets' to current/baseline consumption patterns. Greenhouse gas emissions associated with 'sustainable diets' were on average 25.8\%[95\%CI -27.0 to -14.6] lower than current/baseline consumption patterns, with vegan diets reporting the largest reduction in GHG-emissions (-70.3\% [95\% CI: -90.2 to -50.4]), however, water use was frequently reported to be higher than current/baseline diets. Multiple benefits for both health and the environment were reported in the majority (n = 315[76\%]) of measurements. We identified consistent evidence of both positive health effects and reduced environmental footprints accruing from 'sustainable diets'. The notable exception of increased water use associated with 'sustainable diets' identifies that co-benefits are not universal and some trade-offs are likely. When carefully designed, evidence-based, and adapted to contextual factors, dietary change could play a pivotal role in climate change mitigation, sustainable food systems, and future population health.},

The increase in awareness of young adults is of special importance from the perspective of health and prevention of obesity related chronic diseases. To measure the nutrition literacy level of university students using the Turkish version of Adolescent Nutrition Literacy Scale (ANLS). We evaluated their food habits using the Adolescent Food Habit Checklist (AFHC) tool and analysed it, if the eating habits were affected by nutrition literacy level. SUBJECTS/METHODS: A cross-sectional descriptive study was conducted on randomly selected 276 students studying in the Faculty of Health Sciences of Istanbul Aydin University, Turkey. Data was collected by means of ANLS and AFHC tools by face to face interview method. SPSS statistical sofware (IBM SPSS Statistics 19) was used to analyse the obtained data. RESULTS: Participants comprised of 47.1\% males and 52.9\% females with mean age of 20.0 {$\pm$} 1.60 years. Mean body mass index (BMI) was determined as 22.4 {$\pm$} 3.76 (23.6 {$\pm$} 3.63 males 21.3 {$\pm$} 3.57 females). Functional, interactive and critical nutritional literacy scores for male participants were 22.49 {$\pm$} 5.71, 17.45 {$\pm$} 4.84, and 28.28 {$\pm$} 7.13 respectively (total 64.98 {$\pm$} 10.15). For females the values were 24.66 {$\pm$} 5.13, 20.17 {$\pm$} 4.28, and 32.20 {$\pm$} 5.65 (total 69.72 {$\pm$} 8.59) respectively. For all the three sub-categories of nutrition literacy, the scores acquired by females were significantly higher than males (P \textexclamdown{} 0.001). In the AFHC tool, the mean score acquired by males were 9.26 {$\pm$} 4.18 whereas for females it was 10.37 {$\pm$} 3.40 significantly higher as compared to males (P = 0.007). CONCLUSION: The food habits of female participants were better than males; in accordance with their nutrition literacy status. It may be concluded that food habits are influenced by nutrition literacy and therefore stress much be given to increase the nutrition awareness among children youth as well as adults.

With the increased popularity of online health-food bloggers and 'refined-sugar free' recipes, this review looked to analyse recipes from popular online bloggers to validate the veracity of their 'sugar-free' and 'healthy' claims and assess their adherence to recently implemented nutritional guidelines. Method Four bloggers were randomly selected from the Amazon top 10 booklist and their online blogs were consulted for a selection of recipes which were then nutritionally analysed in relation to their sugar and fat content. Results Eighty percent of the recipes analysed contained more fat than a Mars bar and 70\% contained more fat than a popular online cake recipe, while 25\% of the recipes contained over half of the recommended daily sugar intake as advised by the SACN and the WHO. None of the bloggers analysed used evidence-based approaches for the advice on their blogs. Conclusion Bloggers offer an invaluable platform to disseminate dietary advice to the public; however the recipes in this analysis were not healthy alternatives. The challenge is for government and health organisations to use this platform to promote alternative healthy eating options that align to current national and international guidance.},

  abstract = {Soils are the most complex and diverse ecosystem in the world. In addition to providing humanity with 98.8\% of its food, soils provide a broad range of other services, from carbon storage and greenhouse gas regulation, to flood mitigation and providing support for our sprawling cities. But soil is a finite resource, and rapid human population growth coupled with increasing consumption is placing unprecedented pressure on soils through the intensification of agricultural production \textendash{} the increasing of crop yield per unit area of soil. Indeed, the human population has increased from ca. 250 million in the year 1000, to 6.1 billion in the year 2000, and is projected to reach 9.8 billion by the year 2050. The current intensification of agricultural practices is already resulting in the unsustainable degradation of soils. Major forms of this degradation include the loss of organic matter and the release of greenhouse gases, the over-application of fertilizers, erosion, contamination, acidification, salinization, and loss of genetic diversity. This ongoing soil degradation is decreasing the long-term ability of soils to provide humans with services, including future food production, and is causing environmental harm. It is imperative that the global society is not shortsighted by focusing solely on the near-immediate benefits of soils, such as food supply. A failure to identify the importance of soil within increasingly intensive agricultural systems will undoubtedly have serious consequences for humanity and represents a failure to consider intergenerational equity. Of utmost importance is the need to unequivocally recognize that the degradation of soils leads to a clear economic cost through the loss of services, with such principles needing to be explicitly considered in economic frameworks and decision-making processes at all levels of governance. We contend that the concept of the Water-Food-Energy nexus must be expanded, forming the Water-Soil-Food-Energy nexus.},

Most previous studies that consider this question focus on a single country or compare countries' guidelines without controlling for differences in country-level consumption patterns. To address this gap, we model the carbon footprint of the dietary guidelines from seven different countries, examine the key contributors to this, and control for consumption differences between countries. In this purposive sample, we obtained FBDG from national sources for Germany, India, the Netherlands, Oman, Thailand, Uruguay, and the United States. These were used to structure recommended diets using 6 food groups: protein foods, dairy, grains, fruits, vegetables, and oils/fats. To determine specific quantities of individual foods within these groups, we used data on food supplies available for human consumption for each country from the UN Food and Agriculture Organization's food balance sheets. The greenhouse gas emissions (GHGE) used to produce the foods in these consumption patterns were linked from our own database, constructed from an exhaustive review of the life cycle assessment literature. All guidelines were scaled to a 2000-kcal diet. Daily recommended amounts of dairy foods ranged from a low of 118 ml/d for Oman to a high of 710 ml/d for the US. The GHGE associated with these two recommendations were 0.17 and 1.10 kg CO2-eq/d, respectively. The GHGE associated with the protein food recommendations ranged from 0.03 kg CO2-eq/d in India to 1.84 kg CO2-eq/d in the US, for recommended amounts of 75 g/d and 156 g/d, respectively. Overall, US recommendations had the highest carbon footprint at 3.83 kg CO2-eq/d, 4.5 times that of the recommended diet for India, which had the smallest footprint. After controlling for country-level consumption patterns by applying the US consumption pattern to all countries, US recommendations were still the highest, 19\% and 47\% higher than those of the Netherlands and Germany, respectively. Despite our common human biology, FBDG vary tremendously from one country to the next, as do the associated carbon footprints of these guidelines. Understanding the carbon footprints of different recommendations can assist in future decision-making to incorporate environmental sustainability in dietary guidance.},

Height and weight were measured. The diet of 165 children (62\% of sample) was evaluated by the Icelandic FBDG and the Nordic reference values (NRV) for nutrient intake.Setting Six randomly chosen schools in Reykjavik, Iceland.Results: The FBDG on fruits and vegetables was reached by less than 20\% of the children.

  abstract = {Reducing food losses and waste is considered to be one of the most promising measures to improve food security in the coming decades. Food losses also affect our use of resources, such as freshwater, cropland, and fertilisers. In this paper we estimate the global food supply losses due to lost and wasted food crops, and the resources used to produce them. We also quantify the potential food supply and resource savings that could be made by reducing food losses and waste. We used publically available global databases to conduct the study at the country level.We found that around one quarter of the produced food supply (614kcal/cap/day) is lost within the food supply chain (FSC). The production of these lost and wasted food crops accounts for 24\% of total freshwater resources used in food crop production (27m3/cap/yr), 23\% of total global cropland area (31\texttimes 10-3ha/cap/yr), and 23\% of total global fertiliser use (4.3kg/cap/yr). The per capita use of resources for food losses is largest in North Africa \& West-Central Asia (freshwater and cropland) and North America \& Oceania (fertilisers). The smallest per capita use of resources for food losses is found in Sub-Saharan Africa (freshwater and fertilisers) and in Industrialised Asia (cropland). Relative to total food production, the smallest food supply and resource losses occur in South \& Southeast Asia.If the lowest loss and waste percentages achieved in any region in each step of the FSC could be reached globally, food supply losses could be halved. By doing this, there would be enough food for approximately one billion extra people. Reducing the food losses and waste would thus be an important step towards increased food security, and would also increase the efficiency of resource use in food production. \textcopyright{} 2012 Elsevier B.V.},

Moreover, nutrition confusion was positively associated with nutrition backlash, and nutrition backlash decreased engagement in fruit and vegetable consumption.

Results: The mean score for self-rated nutrition literacy was 2.8 (out of 4), and the mean score for healthy-eating behaviours was 3.07 (out of 5). Results of hierarchical regression showed that nutrition literacy explained 17.2\% of the total variance of healthy-eating behaviours of college students, controlling for confounding variables. Conclusion: The findings of this study showed that nutrition literacy among college students was not optimal, and there was a positive association between higher levels of nutrition literacy and healthier dietary behaviours.

  abstract = {The food-feed competition is one of the complex challenges, and so are the ongoing climate change, land degradation and water shortage for realizing sustainable food production systems. By 2050 the global demand for animal products is projected to increase by 60\% to 70\%, and developing countries will have a lion's share in this increase. Currently, {$\sim$}800 million tonnes of cereals (one-third of total cereal production) are used in animal feed and by 2050 it is projected to be over 1.1 billion tonnes. Most of the increase in feed demand will be in developing countries, which already face many food security challenges. Additional feed required for the projected increased demand of animal products, if met through food grains, will further exacerbate the food insecurity in these countries. Furthermore, globally, the production, processing and transport of feed account for 45\% of the greenhouse gas emissions from the livestock sector. This paper presents approaches for addressing these challenges in quest for making livestock sector more sustainable. The use of novel human-inedible feed resources such as insect meals, leaf meals, protein isolates, single cell protein produced using waste streams, protein hydrolysates, spineless cactus, algae, co-products of the biofuel industry, food wastes among others, has enormous prospects. Efficient use of grasslands also offers possibilities for increasing carbon sequestration, land reclamation and livestock productivity. Opportunities also exist for decreasing feed wastages by simple and well proven practices such as use of appropriate troughs, increase in efficiency of harvesting crop residues and their conversion to complete feeds especially in the form of densified feed blocks or pellets, feeding as per the nutrient requirements, among others. Available evidence have been presented to substantiate arguments that: (a) for successful and sustained adoption of a feed technology, participation of the private sector and a sound business plan are required, (b) for sustainability of the livestock production systems, it is also important to consider the consumption of animal products and a case has been presented to assess future needs of animal source foods based on their requirements for healthy living, (c) for dairy animals, calculation of Emission Intensity based on the lifetime lactation rather than one lactation may also be considered and (d) for assessment of the efficiency of livestock production systems a holistic approach is required that takes into consideration social dimensions and net human-edible protein output from the system in addition to carbon and water footprints.},

  abstract = {Background: Studies on theoretical diets are not sufficient to implement sustainable diets in practice because of unknown cultural acceptability. In contrast, self-selected diets can be considered culturally acceptable. Objective: The objective was to identify the most sustainable diets consumed by people in everyday life. Design: The diet-related greenhouse gas emissions (GHGE) for self-selected diets of 1918 adults participating in the cross-sectional French national dietary survey Individual and National Survey on Food Consumption (INCA2) were estimated. "Lower-Carbon," "Higher-Quality," and "More Sustainable" diets were defined as having GHGE lower than the overall median value, a probability of adequate nutrition intake (PANDiet) score (a measure of the overall nutritional adequacy of a diet) higher than the overall median value, and a combination of both criteria, respectively. Diet cost, as a proxy for affordability, and energy density were also assessed. Results: More Sustainable diets were consumed by 23\% of men and 20\% of women, and their GHGE values were 19\% and 17\% lower than the population average (mean) value, respectively. In comparison with the average value, Lower-Carbon diets achieved a 20\% GHGE reduction and lower cost, but they were not sustainable because they had a lower PANDiet score. Higher-Quality diets were not sustainable because of their above-average GHGE and cost. More Sustainable diets had an above-average PANDiet score and a below-average energy density, cost, GHGE, and energy content; the energy share of plant-based products was increased by 20\% and 15\% compared with the average for men and women, respectively. Conclusions: A strength of this study was that most of the dimensions for "sustainable diets" were considered, ie, not only nutritional quality and GHGE but also affordability and cultural acceptability. A reduction in diet-related GHGE by 20\% while maintaining high nutritional quality seems realistic. This goal could be achieved at no extra cost by reducing energy intake and energy density and increasing the share of plant-based products. \textcopyright{} 2014 American Society for Nutrition.},

  abstract = {The evidence base for dietary guidance has traditionally relied on research examining the relation between individual components of diet-nutrients, foods-and various health outcomes. Evidence is steadily accruing, however, for a role of dietary patterns in chronic disease prevention, which considers the potential for additive and interactive effects of dietary constituents (1). Randomized controlled trials have demonstrated that dietary patterns can significantly lower chronic disease risk factors (2) or outcomes (3,4), but feeding trials are expensive and burdensome to participants; therefore, most evidence will likely come from observational studies. One way to test the relation of healthy diet patterns and chronic disease outcomes in epidemiologic studies is to create dietary scores to quantify how closely study participants\~O diets conform to the diet pattern being examined. Dozens of diet scores have been developed as measures of adherence to dietary guidelines, regional models of diet, or other hypothesized ideals. Despite increasing recognition that diet patterns may importantly influence disease risk, a number of issues have made summarizing this body of evidence challenging. Adaptations of the same score may vary across studies depending on investigator interpretation, dietary assessment methods, and even changes over time in guidelines on which a score is based. In 2010, the U.S. Dietary Guidelines for Americans scientific expert committee considered the diet patterns literature too heterogeneous to draw conclusions on the role of diet patterns in health outcomes. This year, the 2015 U.S. Dietary Guidelines Committee will again consider the evidence on dietary patterns and chronic disease risk. In this issue of The Journal of Nutrition, Reedy et al. (5) evaluated the association of 4 a priori-defined diet scores reflecting commonly examined patterns and risk of mortality from cardio-vascular disease (CVD), 2 cancer, or all causes combined in older U.S. men and women in the NIH-AARP Diet and Health Study prospective cohort. By using information from FFQs completed by 424,662 participants at baseline, the authors calculated how closely participants\~O diets matched the following 4 diet quality scores: 1) the Healthy Eating Index-2010 (HEI-2010) (6), 2) the Alternate Healthy Eating Index-2010 (AHEI-2010) (7), 3) the Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension (DASH) diet score (8), and 4) a modified (alternate) Mediterranean Diet (aMED) (9). The HEI-2010 measures how closely participants\~O diets match the 2010 U.S. Dietary Guidelines for Americans, which serves as the cornerstone of food and nutrition policy in the United States. The AHEI-2010 is an alternative to the HEI and is based on foods and nutrients predictive of chronic disease. The DASH score highlights key components of the original (2) and DASH-Sodium (10) feeding trials that showed significant blood pressure lowering with a diet pattern high in fruit, vegetables, whole grains, low-fat dairy, and nuts and low in sodium, saturated fat, sugar, and red and processed meats. The aMED score is modified from the Greek version of the Mediterranean diet circa 1960 when chronic disease rates in the region were among the lowest in the world. The Mediterranean diet made headlines last year when the Spanish Prevenc\'i on con Dieta Mediterr\'aneaMediterr\textasciiacute Mediterr\'anea (PRE-DIMED) trial (3) reported lower incidence of major cardiovas-cular events in at-risk individuals who were counseled to follow a Mediterranean diet supplemented with olive oil or nuts, compared with a low-fat control diet. In the study by Reedy et al. (5), \textquestiondown 86,000 study participants died during 15 y of follow-up. The authors found that higher scores for all 4 diets were significantly associated with lower risk of mortality: comparing individuals whose scores were in the highest vs. lowest quintile, results ranged from 17\% to 24\% lower for risk of all-cause mortality, from 14\% to 28\% lower for risk of CVD mortality, and from 12\% to 24\% lower for risk of cancer mortality. That all scores predicted lower mortality is not entirely surprising because many of their components are the same (see Table 1), including a diet high in fruit, vegetables, whole grains, nuts, and legumes. The correlations between scores ranged from 0.49 to 0.69. The scoring of most protein sources is similar, except that the HEI-2010 gives credit for greater consumption of any type of meat, whereas the others specifically penalize red and processed meat consumption. Where included, scores for sugar, salt, and most FAs are qualitatively similar among the patterns tested. Some distinct differences among the scores should be noted. Moderate alcohol consumption is promoted in the aMED and AHEI-2010 scores, in contrast to the HEI-2010 and the DASH scores. Although dairy is promoted by the HEI-2010 and DASH, it is not encouraged by the other 2 patterns. The AHEI-2010 is weighted more heavily toward FA composition of the diet and is the only score to deduct points for consuming trans fats, which may, in part, explain its strong inverse association with CVD mortality. Other methodologic issues in score derivation deserve consideration. How does the different weighting scheme and energy adjustment before analysis in the HEI-2010 or the use of cohort-specific distributions to define cutoffs in the aMED and DASH scores influence results? How does calculation of serving sizes using the MyPyramid Equivalents database influence individual},

  abstract = {Comprehensive assessment tools are needed that reliably describe environmental impacts of different agricultural systems in order to develop sustainable high yielding agricultural production systems with minimal impacts on the environment. Today, Life Cycle Assessment (LCA) is increasingly used to assess and compare the environmental sustainability of agricultural products from conventional and organic agriculture. However, LCA studies comparing agricultural products from conventional and organic farming systems report a wide variation in the resource efficiency of products from these systems. The studies show that impacts per area farmed land are usually less in organic systems, but related to the quantity produced impacts are often higher. We reviewed 34 comparative LCA studies of organic and conventional agricultural products to analyze whether this result is solely due to the usually lower yields in organic systems or also due to inaccurate modeling within LCA. Comparative LCAs on agricultural products from organic and conventional farming systems often do not adequately differentiate the specific characteristics of the respective farming system in the goal and scope definition and in the inventory analysis. Further, often only a limited number of impact categories are assessed within the impact assessment not allowing for a comprehensive environmental assessment. The most critical points we identified relate to the nitrogen (N) fluxes influencing acidification, eutrophication, and global warming potential, and biodiversity. Usually, N-emissions in LCA inventories of agricultural products are based on model calculations. Modeled N-emissions often do not correspond with the actual amount of N left in the system that may result in potential emissions. Reasons for this may be that N-models are not well adapted to the mode of action of organic fertilizers and that N-emission models often are built on assumptions from conventional agriculture leading to even greater deviances for organic systems between the amount of N calculated by emission models and the actual amount of N available for emissions. Improvements are needed regarding a more precise differentiation between farming systems and regarding the development of N emission models that better represent actual N-fluxes within different systems. We recommend adjusting N- and C-emissions during farmyard manure management and farmyard manure fertilization in plant production to the feed ration provided in the animal production of the respective farming system leading to different N- and C-compositions within the excrement. In the future, more representative background data on organic farming systems (e.g. N content of farmyard manure) should be generated and compiled so as to be available for use within LCA inventories. Finally, we recommend conducting consequential LCA - if possible - when using LCA for policy-making or strategic environmental planning to account for different functions of the analyzed farming systems.},

  abstract = {Abstract. This study quantifies the green, blue and grey water footprint of global crop production in a spatially-explicit way for the period 1996\textendash 2005. The assessment improves upon earlier research by taking a high-resolution approach, estimating the water footprint of 126 crops at a 5 by 5 arc minute grid. We have used a grid-based dynamic water balance model to calculate crop water use over time, with a time step of one day. The model takes into account the daily soil water balance and climatic conditions for each grid cell. In addition, the water pollution associated with the use of nitrogen fertilizer in crop production is estimated for each grid cell. The crop evapotranspiration of additional 20 minor crops is calculated with the CROPWAT model. In addition, we have calculated the water footprint of more than two hundred derived crop products, including various flours, beverages, fibres and biofuels. We have used the water footprint assessment framework as in the guideline of the Water Footprint Network. Considering the water footprints of primary crops, we see that the global average water footprint per ton of crop increases from sugar crops (roughly 200 m3 ton-1), vegetables (300 m3 ton-1), roots and tubers (400 m3 ton-1), fruits (1000 m3 ton-1), cereals (1600 m3 ton-1), oil crops (2400 m3 ton-1) to pulses (4000 m3 ton-1). The water footprint varies, however, across different crops per crop category and per production region as well. Besides, if one considers the water footprint per kcal, the picture changes as well. When considered per ton of product, commodities with relatively large water footprints are: coffee, tea, cocoa, tobacco, spices, nuts, rubber and fibres. The analysis of water footprints of different biofuels shows that bio-ethanol has a lower water footprint (in m3 GJ-1) than biodiesel, which supports earlier analyses. The crop used matters significantly as well: the global average water footprint of bio-ethanol based on sugar beet amounts to 51 m3 GJ-1, while this is 121 m3 GJ-1 for maize. The global water footprint related to crop production in the period 1996\textendash 2005 was 7404 billion cubic meters per year (78 \% green, 12 \% blue, 10 \% grey). A large total water footprint was calculated for wheat (1087 Gm3 yr-1), rice (992 Gm3 yr-1) and maize (770 Gm3 yr-1). Wheat and rice have the largest blue water footprints, together accounting for 45 \% of the global blue water footprint. At country level, the total water footprint was largest for India (1047 Gm3 yr-1), China (967 Gm3 yr-1) and the USA (826 Gm3 yr-1). A relatively large total blue water footprint as a result of crop production is observed in the Indus river basin (117 Gm3 yr-1) and the Ganges river basin (108 Gm3 yr-1). The two basins together account for 25 \% of the blue water footprint related to global crop production. Globally, rain-fed agriculture has a water footprint of 5173 Gm3 yr-1 (91 \% green, 9 \% grey); irrigated agriculture has a water footprint of 2230 Gm3 yr-1 (48 \% green, 40 \% blue, 12 \% grey).},

  abstract = {The increase in the consumption of animal products is likely to put further pressure on the world's freshwater resources. This paper provides a comprehensive account of the water footprint of animal products, considering different production systems and feed composition per animal type and country. Nearly one-third of the total water footprint of agriculture in the world is related to the production of animal products. The water footprint of any animal product is larger than the water footprint of crop products with equivalent nutritional value. The average water footprint per calorie for beef is 20 times larger than for cereals and starchy roots. The water footprint per gram of protein for milk, eggs and chicken meat is 1. 5 times larger than for pulses. The unfavorable feed conversion efficiency for animal products is largely responsible for the relatively large water footprint of animal products compared to the crop products. Animal products from industrial systems generally consume and pollute more ground- and surface-water resources than animal products from grazing or mixed systems. The rising global meat consumption and the intensification of animal production systems will put further pressure on the global freshwater resources in the coming decades. The study shows that from a freshwater perspective, animal products from grazing systems have a smaller blue and grey water footprint than products from industrial systems, and that it is more water-efficient to obtain calories, protein and fat through crop products than animal products. \textcopyright{} 2012 The Author(s).},

A comprehensive description of the development of the SHARP-ID is provided in this article. In the SHARP-ID, environmental impact assessment was based on attributional life cycle analyses using environmental indicators greenhouse gas emission (GHGE) and land use (LU). Life cycle inventory data of 182 primary products were combined with data on production, trade and transport, and adjusted for consumption amount using conversions factors for production, edible portion, cooking losses and gains, and for food losses and waste in order to derive estimates of GHGE and LU for the foods as eaten. Extrapolations based on similarities in type of food, production system and ingredient composition were made to obtain estimates of GHGE and LU per kg of food as eaten for 944 food items coded with a unique FoodEx2-code of EFSA and consumed in four European countries, i.e. Denmark, Czech Republic, Italy and France. This LCA-food-item database can be linked to food intake data collected at the individual level in order to calculate the environmental impact of individual's diets. The application of this database to European survey data is described in an original research article entitled ``Dietary choices and environmental impact in four European countries'' (Mertens et al., 2019).},

  abstract = {Effective food policies in Europe require insight into the environmental impact of consumers' diet to contribute to global nutrition security in an environmentally sustainable way. The present study therefore aimed to assess the environmental impact associated with dietary intake across four European countries, and to explain sources of variations in environmental impact by energy intake, demographics and diet composition. Individual-level dietary intake data were obtained from nationally-representative dietary surveys, by using two non-consecutive days of a 24-h recall or a diet record, from Denmark (DK, n = 1710), Czech Republic (CZ, n = 1666), Italy (IT, n = 2184), and France (FR, n = 2246). Dietary intake data were linked to a newly developed pan-European environmental sustainability indicator database that contains greenhouse gas emissions (GHGE) and land use (LU) values for {$\sim$}900 foods. To explain the variation in environmental impact of diets, multilevel regression models with random intercept and random slopes were fitted according to two levels: adults (level 1, n = 7806) and country (level 2, n = 4). In the models, diet-related GHGE or LU was the dependent variable, and the parameter of interest, i.e. either total energy intake or demographics or food groups, the exploratory variables. A 200-kcal higher total energy intake was associated with a 9\% and a 10\% higher daily GHGE and LU. Expressed per 2000 kcal, mean GHGE ranged from 4.4 (CZ) to 6.3 kgCO2eq/2000 kcal (FR), and LU ranged from 5.7 (CZ) to 8.0 m2*year/2000 kcal (FR). Dietary choices explained most of the variation between countries. A 5 energy percent (50 g/2000 kcal) higher meat intake was associated with a 10\% and a 14\% higher GHGE and LU density, with ruminant meat being the main contributor to environmental footprints. In conclusion, intake of energy, total meat and the proportion of ruminant meat explained most of the variation in GHGE and LU of European diets. Contributions of food groups to environmental footprints however varied between countries, suggesting that cultural preferences play an important role in environmental footprints of consumers. In particular, Findings from the present study will be relevant for national-specific food policy measures towards a more environmentally-friendly diet.},

Most previous research has focused on preparing, rather than eating, home cooked food; used small, non-population based samples; and studied markers of nutrient intake, rather than overall diet quality or health. We aimed to assess whether frequency of consuming home cooked meals was cross-sectionally associated with diet quality and cardio-metabolic health. Methods: We used baseline data from a United Kingdom population-based cohort study of adults aged 29 to 64 years (n = 11,396). Participants self-reported frequency of consuming home cooked main meals. Diet quality was assessed using the Mediterranean Diet Score, Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension (DASH) score, fruit and vegetable intake calculated from a 130-item food frequency questionnaire, and plasma vitamin C. Markers of cardio-metabolic health were researcher-measured body mass index (BMI), percentage body fat, haemoglobin A1c (HbA1c), cholesterol and hypertension. Differences across the three exposure categories were assessed using linear regression (diet variables) and logistic regression (health variables). Results: Eating home cooked meals more frequently was associated with greater adherence to DASH and Mediterranean diets, greater fruit and vegetable intakes and higher plasma vitamin C, in adjusted models. Those eating home cooked meals more than five times, compared with less than three times per week, consumed 62.3 g more fruit (99\% CI 43.2 to 81.5) and 97.8 g more vegetables (99\% CI 84.4 to 111.2) daily. More frequent consumption of home cooked meals was associated with greater likelihood of having normal range BMI and normal percentage body fat. Associations with HbA1c, cholesterol and hypertension were not significant in adjusted models. Those consuming home cooked meals more than five times, compared with less than three times per week, were 28\% less likely to have overweight BMI (99\% CI 8 to 43\%), and 24\% less likely to have excess percentage body fat (99\% CI 5 to 40\%). Conclusions: In a large population-based cohort study, eating home cooked meals more frequently was associated with better dietary quality and lower adiposity. Further prospective research is required to identify whether consumption of home cooked meals has causal effects on diet and health.},

The OPUS (Optimal well-being, development and health for Danish children through a healthy New Nordic Diet) project investigates whether it is possible to develop a healthy New Nordic Diet (NND) that is palatable, environmentally friendly and based on foods originating from the Nordic region. The present paper describes the overall guidelines for the NND, developed and investigated in the multidisciplinary, 5-year OPUS research project. All guidelines are described in relation to the key principles: health, gastronomic potential and Nordic identity, and sustainability. Results The NND is described by the overall guidelines: (i) more calories from plant foods and fewer from meat; (ii) more foods from the sea and lakes; and (iii) more foods from the wild countryside. These overall guidelines result in a set of proposed dietary components which will be presented in a subsequent paper. Conclusions Both the guidelines and the diet are composed taking the potential health-promoting properties and Nordic identity of the NND into account, as well as concern for environmental issues and gastronomic potential. \textcopyright{} Copyright 2012 The Authors.},

Although absorption of iron from the gastrointestinal tract is strictly controlled, excretion is limited to iron lost from exfoliation of skin and gastrointestinal cells, customary and abnormal blood loss, and menses. Individuals highly vulnerable to iron deficiency have high iron needs, as during growth or pregnancy; high iron loss, as during marked hemorrhage or excessive and/or frequent menstrual losses; or diets with low iron content or bioavailability. Food iron is classified as heme or nonheme. Approximately half of the iron in meat, fish, and poultry is heme iron. Depending on an individual's iron stores, 15\% to 35\% of heme iron is absorbed. Food contains more nonheme iron and, thus, it makes the larger contribution to the body's iron pool despite its lower absorption rate of 2\% to 20\%. Absorption of nonheme iron is markedly influenced by the levels of iron stores and by concomitantly consumed dietary components. Enhancing factors, such as ascorbic acid and meat/fish/poultry, may increase nonheme iron bioavailability fourfold.},

However, little is known about how changing the main protein source from red meat to fish may influence the choice of side dishes. Objective: To investigate whether side dish choices differed between red meat and fish dinners. Moreover, to compare intakes of macronutrients and selected micronutrients in red meat and fish dinners and to see whether whole-day intakes of these nutrients differed between days with red meat dinners and days with fish dinners. Design: Data were collected in a cross-sectional nationwide Norwegian dietary survey using two nonconsecutive telephone-administered 24-h recalls. The recalls were conducted approximately 4 weeks apart. In total, 2,277 dinners from 1,517 participants aged 1870 were included in the analyses. Results: Fish dinners were more likely to include potatoes and carrots than red meat dinners, whereas red meat dinners more often contained bread, tomato sauce, and cheese. Red meat dinners contained more energy and iron; had higher percentages of energy (E\%) from fat, saturated fat, and monounsaturated fat; and a lower E\% from protein and polyunsaturated fat than fish dinners. Fish dinners contained more Vitamin D, b-carotene, and folate than red meat dinners. Similar differences were found when comparing whole-day intakes of the same nutrients on days with red meat versus fish dinners. Conclusion: Fish dinners were accompanied by different side dishes than red meat dinners. With regard to nutrient content, fish dinners generally had a healthier profile than red meat dinners. However, iron intake was higher for red meat dinners. Information about associated foods will be useful both for developing public health guidelines and when studying associations between dietary factors and health outcomes.},

This test is useful as a general nonparametric test for comparing more than two independent samples. It can be used to test whether such samples come from the same distribution. This test is powerful alternative to the one-way analysis of variance. Nonparametric ANOVA has no assumption of normality of random error but the independence of random error is required. If the Kruskal-Wallis statistic is significant, the nonparametric multiple comparison tests are useful methods for further analysis.

  abstract = {As aquaculture becomes more important for feeding the growing world population, so too do the required natural resources needed to produce aquaculture feed. While there is potential to replace fish meal and fish oil with terrestrial feed ingredients, it is important to understand both the positive and negative implications of such a development. The use of feed with a large proportion of terrestrial feed may reduce the pressure on fisheries to provide feed for fish, but at the same time it may significantly increase the pressure on freshwater resources, due to water consumption and pollution in crop production for aquafeed. Here the green, blue and gray water footprint of cultured fish and crustaceans related to the production of commercial feed for the year 2008 has been determined for the major farmed species, representing 88\% of total fed production. The green, blue and gray production-weighted average feed water footprints of fish and crustaceans fed commercial aquafeed are estimated at 1629m3/t, 179m3/t and 166m3/t, respectively. The estimated global total water footprint of commercial aquafeed was 31-35km3 in 2008. The top five contributors to the total water footprint of commercial feed are Nile tilapia, Grass carp, Whiteleg shrimp, Common carp and Atlantic salmon, which together have a water footprint of 18.2km3. An analysis of alternative diets revealed that the replacement of fish meal and fish oil with terrestrial feed ingredients may further increase pressure on freshwater resources. At the same time economic consumptive water productivity may be reduced, especially for carnivorous species. The results of the present study show that, for the aquaculture sector to grow sustainably, freshwater consumption and pollution due to aquafeed need to be taken into account.},

Iodine deficiency disorders (IDD) comprise a range of adverse maternal and fetal outcomes, with the most significant irreversible effect resulting from neurodevelopmental deficits in fetal brain caused by deficient iodine status during early pregnancy. The objective of this scoping review was to summarize the studies that assessed iodine status of women of reproductive age in the USA. A systematic review of literature using the PRISMA Extension for Scoping Reviews (PRISMA-ScR) statement was conducted. PubMed, Medline, CINAHL, EMBASE, EBSCOHost, Cochrane, ERIC, Google Scholar, and Web of Science databases were searched, 1652 records were identified. One thousand six hundred forty-one records that did not satisfy the inclusion/exclusion criteria and quality review were excluded, and 11 peer-reviewed articles were determined to be eligible for this scoping review. Despite the USA being considered iodine sufficient for the general population, the US dietary iodine intakes have decreased drastically since the 1970s, with iodine deficiency reemerging in vulnerable groups such as women of reproductive age. Although data to conduct a scoping review of iodine status among women of reproductive age in the USA was scarce, majority of the articles reviewed demonstrate emergent iodine deficiency in this population of women of reproductive age, indicating alarm for a public health concern needing immediate attention.},

These changes in turn cause a cascade of factors that exacerbate infectious disease emergence, such as forest fragmentation, disease introduction, pollution, poverty, and human migration. The Working Group on Land Use Change and Disease Emergence grew out of a special colloquium that convened international experts in infectious diseases, ecology, and environmental health to assess the current state of knowledge and to develop recommendations for addressing these environmental health challenges. The group established a systems model approach and priority lists of infectious diseases affected by ecologic degradation. Policy-relevant levels of the model include specific health risk factors, landscape or habitat change, and institutional (economic and behavioral) levels. The group recommended creating Centers of Excellence in Ecology and Health Research and Training, based at regional universities and/or research institutes with close links to the surrounding communities. The centers' objectives would be 3-fold: a) to provide information to local communities about the links between environmental change and public health; b) to facilitate fully interdisciplinary research from a variety of natural, social, and health sciences and train professionals who can conduct interdisciplinary research; and c) to engage in science-based communication and assessment for policy making toward sustainable health and ecosystems.},

Design Dietary intake, nutritional composition, GHGE and prices were combined for 402 foods selected among those most consumed by participants of the Individual National Study on Food Consumption. Linear programming was used to model diets with stepwise GHGE reductions, minimized departure from observed diet and three scenarios of nutritional constraints: none (FREE), on macronutrients (MACRO) and for all nutrient recommendations (ADEQ). Nutritional quality was assessed using the mean adequacy ratio (MAR) and solid energy density (SED). Setting France. Subjects Adults (n 1899). Results In FREE and MACRO scenarios, imposing up to 30 \% GHGE reduction did not affect the MAR, SED and food group pattern of the observed diet, but required substitutions within food groups; higher GHGE reductions decreased diet cost, but also nutritional quality, even with constraints on macronutrients. Imposing all nutritional recommendations (ADEQ) increased the fruits and vegetables quantity, reduced SED and slightly increased diet cost without additional modifications induced by the GHGE constraint up to 30 \% reduction; higher GHGE reductions decreased diet cost but required non-trivial dietary shifts from the observed diet. Not all the nutritional recommendations could be met for GHGE reductions {$\geq$}70 \%. Conclusions Moderate GHGE reductions ({$\leq$}30 \%) were compatible with nutritional adequacy and affordability without adding major food group shifts to those induced by nutritional recommendations. Higher GHGE reductions either impaired nutritional quality, even when macronutrient recommendations were imposed, or required non-trivial dietary shifts compromising acceptability to reach nutritional adequacy.},

Pasture is furthermore the single most extensive form of land cover, currently comprising about 22\textendash 26\% of the earth's ice-free land surface. Despite the importance and variable expressions of animal production, distinctions among different systems are effectively absent from studies of land use and land cover change. This deficiency is improving; however, livestock production system classifications are rarely applied in this context, and the most popular global land cover inventories still present only a single, usually poorly defined category of ``pasture'' or ``rangeland'' with no characterization of land use. There is a marked lack of bottom-up, evidence-based methodology, creating a pressing need to incorporate cross-disciplinary evidence of past and present animal production systems into global change studies. Here, we present a framework, modified from existing livestock production systems, that is rooted in sociocultural, socioeconomic, and ecological contexts. The framework defines and characterizes the range of land usage pertaining to animal production, and is suitable for application in land use inventories and scenarios, land cover modeling, and studies on sustainable land use in the past, present, and future.},

Impact can vary 50-fold among producers of the same product, creating substantial mitigation opportunities. However, mitigation is complicated by trade-offs, multiple ways for producers to achieve low impacts, and interactions throughout the supply chain. Producers have limits on how far they can reduce impacts. Most strikingly, impacts of the lowest-impact animal products typically exceed those of vegetable substitutes, providing new evidence for the importance of dietary change. Cumulatively, our findings support an approach where producers monitor their own impacts, flexibly meet environmental targets by choosing from multiple practices, and communicate their impacts to consumers.},

However, to the best of our knowledge, to date no systematic literature review has been conducted on household food waste and little comprehensive explanation has yet been offered for wasteful household behaviour. Therefore, the aim of this study was to carry out a systematic review of the literature produced over an eighteen-year period (2000\textendash 2018) in order to gain a deeper understanding of multiple, complex facets of the food waste phenomenon at consumer level. Drawing on the results of the systematic literature review and of the behavioural and marketing theories, we propose a new theoretical framework ``The Household Wasteful Behaviour Framework'', with the aim of better explaining food waste behaviour at household level. Results can be useful to better target social norm and educational campaigns both at private and public level.},

Organic farming systems produce lower yields compared with conventional agriculture. However, they are more profitable and environmentally friendly, and deliver equally or more nutritious foods that contain less (or no) pesticide residues, compared with conventional farming. Moreover, initial evidence indicates that organic agricultural systems deliver greater ecosystem services and social benefits. Although organic agriculture has an untapped role to play when it comes to the establishment of sustainable farming systems, no single approach will safely feed the planet. Rather, a blend of organic and other innovative farming systems is needed. Significant barriers exist to adopting these systems, however, and a diversity of policy instruments will be required to facilitate their development and implementation.},

Meanwhile, climate change is a threat to livestock production because of the impact on quality of feed crop and forage, water availability, animal and milk production, livestock diseases, animal reproduction, and biodiversity. This study reviews the global impacts of climate change on livestock production, the contribution of livestock production to climate change, and specific climate change adaptation and mitigation strategies in the livestock sector. Livestock production will be limited by climate variability as animal water consumption is expected to increase by a factor of three, demand for agricultural lands increase due to need for 70\% growth in production, and food security concern since about one-third of the global cereal harvest is used for livestock feed. Meanwhile, the livestock sector contributes 14.5\% of global greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions, driving further climate change. Consequently, the livestock sector will be a key player in the mitigation of GHG emissions and improving global food security. Therefore, in the transition to sustainable livestock production, there is a need for: a) assessments related to the use of adaptation and mitigation measures tailored to the location and livestock production system in use, and b) policies that support and facilitate the implementation of climate change adaptation and mitigation measures.},

To date, the location and productivity potential of economically water scarce croplands remain unknown. We develop a monthly agrohydrological analysis to map agricultural regions affected by agricultural economic water scarcity. We find these regions account for up to 25\% of the global croplands, mostly across Sub-Saharan Africa, Eastern Europe, and Central Asia. Sustainable irrigation of economically water scarce croplands could feed an additional 840 million people while preventing further aggravation of blue water scarcity.},

  abstract = {Objectives: Development of a diet optimization methodology, forming the next generation of food-based dietary guidelines (FBDG) in Germany, to identify dietary changes accounting for various dimensions: diet-health relations, environmental impact, and nutrient needs while staying culturally acceptable. Methods: Three parameters define the German Nutrition Optimization Model (GNOM): The decision variables, which are observed food intakes (FoodEx2 food grouping); acceptability constraints (acceptabil-ity upper limits (AL) are set for foods based on P95), and the linear objective function. The latter consists of three components that are weighted between each other and minimizes environmental impact (greenhouse-gas emissions and land use), diet-related health burden (disability adjusted life years), and relative deviation from the observed dietary intake (cultural acceptability). Also, deviations from nutritional needs for 39 nutrients are minimized. Five models were run on the adult population by increasing weight on diet-health and decreasing weight on cultural acceptability progressively (by steps of 20\%, from 0\% in model 1 (M1) to 80\% in model 5 (M5)), with a fixed environmental weight at 20\%. Dietary changes are exemplary described for fruits, vegetables, whole grains and red meat. Results: All models satisfied nutrient needs and, compared to the observed diet, increased in fruits, vegetables, and whole grains and decreased in red meat; dietary changes were higher with increasing weight on diet-health. Compared to the observed intake (174,4g/d), fruits increased moderately in M1-3 (205,7g/d-338,8g/d) and reached the AL of 552g/d in M4 and M5. Vegetables reached the AL of 267g/d in every model (observed intake: 96,3g/d) except M1 (261,5g/d). Whole grains increased progressively from 13g/d in observed intake to 16,3g/d and 16,7g/d in M1 and M2, 61,9g and 67,9g in M3 and M4 and increased strongly to 250,7g/d in M5. The observed amount of red meat was 34,4g/d, which dropped from 2,5g/d in M1 to 0g/d in M5. Conclusions: This methodology accounts for multidimensional requirements in FBDGs and is flexible regarding the importance given to each dimension. Preliminary results suggest that using this innovative approach to operationalize diet-health relations, GNOM is able to help derive German FBDG.},

Red meat recipes were not significantly different from poultry recipes for risk nutrients studied; poultry recipes were higher in sodium and energy compared with red meat recipes. Conclusions and Implications: The public should be aware of the nutritional limitations of popularfood blogs; dietitians could assist in modifying blog recipes for individuals and partner with bloggersto improve the nutritional profile of recipes. \textcopyright{} 2013 Society for Nutrition Education and Behavior.},

To understand how freshwater scarcity constrains production of these goods, we need to consider limits to the green water footprint (WF g ), the green water flow allocated to human society. However, research traditionally focuses on scarcity of blue water\textendash\textendash groundwater and surface water. Here we expand the debate on water scarcity by considering green water scarcity (WS g ). At 5 \texttimes{} 5 arc-minute spatial resolution, we quantify WF g and the maximum sustainable level to this footprint (WF g,m ), while accounting for green water requirements to support biodiversity. We then estimate WS g per country as the ratio of the national aggregate WF g to the national aggregate WF g,m . We find that globally WF g amounts to 56\% of WF g,m , and overshoots it in several places, for example in countries in Europe, Central America, the Middle East, and South Asia. The sustainably available green water flows in these countries are mostly or fully allocated to human activities (predominately agriculture and forestry), occasionally at the cost of green water flows earmarked for nature. By ignoring limits to the growing human WF g , we risk further loss of ecosystem values that depend on the remaining untouched green water flows. We emphasize that green water is a critical and limited resource that should explicitly be part of any assessment of water scarcity, food security, or bioenergy potential.},

It is essential to evaluate trends in dietary intake, food sources, and diet quality to inform policy makers. Objective To investigate trends in dietary macronutrient intake, food sources, and diet quality among US adults. Design, Setting, and Participants Serial cross-sectional analysis of the US nationally representative 24-hour dietary recall data from 9 National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey cycles (1999-2016) among adults aged 20 years or older. Exposure Survey cycle. Main Outcomes and Measures Dietary intake of macronutrients and their subtypes, food sources, and the Healthy Eating Index 2015 (range, 0-100; higher scores indicate better diet quality; a minimal clinically important difference has not been defined). Results There were 43 996 respondents (weighted mean age, 46.9 years; 51.9\% women). From 1999 to 2016, the estimated energy from total carbohydrates declined from 52.5\% to 50.5\% (difference, -2.02\%; 95\% CI, -2.41\% to -1.63\%), whereas that of total protein and total fat increased from 15.5\% to 16.4\% (difference, 0.82\%; 95\% CI, 0.67\%-0.97\%) and from 32.0\% to 33.2\% (difference, 1.20\%; 95\% CI, 0.84\%-1.55\%), respectively (allP \textexclamdown{} .001 for trend). Estimated energy from low-quality carbohydrates decreased by 3.25\% (95\% CI, 2.74\%-3.75\%;P \textexclamdown{} .001 for trend) from 45.1\% to 41.8\%. Increases were observed in estimated energy from high-quality carbohydrates (by 1.23\% [95\% CI, 0.84\%-1.61\%] from 7.42\% to 8.65\%), plant protein (by 0.38\% [95\% CI, 0.28\%-0.49\%] from 5.38\% to 5.76\%), saturated fatty acids (by 0.36\% [95\% CI, 0.20\%-0.51\%] from 11.5\% to 11.9\%), and polyunsaturated fatty acids (by 0.65\% [95\% CI, 0.56\%-0.74\%] from 7.58\% to 8.23\%) (allP \textexclamdown{} .001 for trend). The estimated overall Healthy Eating Index 2015 increased from 55.7 to 57.7 (difference, 2.01; 95\% CI, 0.86-3.16;P \textexclamdown{} .001 for trend). Trends in high- and low-quality carbohydrates primarily reflected higher estimated energy from whole grains (0.65\%) and reduced estimated energy from added sugars (-2.00\%), respectively. Trends in plant protein were predominantly due to higher estimated intake of whole grains (0.12\%) and nuts (0.09\%). Conclusions and Relevance From 1999 to 2016, US adults experienced a significant decrease in percentage of energy intake from low-quality carbohydrates and significant increases in percentage of energy intake from high-quality carbohydrates, plant protein, and polyunsaturated fat. Despite improvements in macronutrient composition and diet quality, continued high intake of low-quality carbohydrates and saturated fat remained.},

While previous research largely focuses on understanding why consumers might not respond to healthy eating communications, this paper seeks to uncover the various behavioral responses to such campaigns, particularly those that contravene health communication objectives. Using an interpretive methodology, findings suggest that most participants do respond to health communications by striving to eat healthily, but inadequate nutrition information derived from unreliable sources, flawed baseline nutrition knowledge, and poor nutrition literacy hinder participants' efforts. Inconsistent, incomplete, and contradictory information leaves many participants feeling confused about how to implement healthy eating habits. Further, a lack of ability to differentiate between credible and unreliable sources of nutrition information means that many participants blame their confusion on policymakers, and express frustration and cynicism toward vague and often contradictory communications. This, in turn, increases participants' reliance on food adverts, product labels, and other commercial sources of ambiguous yet appealing information. The paper's theoretical contribution includes a consumer confusion framework for healthy eating, and policy implications highlight that health campaigns seeking to increase consumer awareness of healthy eating are not enough. Policymakers must become the most credible sources of information about healthy eating, and distinguish themselves from competing and unreliable sources of nutrition information.},

We reviewed 29 studies in high-income countries that used various methodologies to define a healthier, more sustainable diet. Diets aligned with dietary guidelines, containing less meat and higher amounts of plant-derived foods (vegetables, pulses [beans/lentils], fruit, wholegrains, nuts, seeds) would likely offer environmental benefits ({$\sim$}20\textendash 50\% lower greenhouse gas emissions [GHGE] and land use) and improve population health, although may not reduce water footprint. Changes in consumption of milk products and eggs were inconsistent in optimisation studies, perhaps reflecting trade-offs between their nutrient contribution and environmental impact. Foods high in fat, salt and/or sugar, and beverages (e.g. tea, coffee and fruit juices) contributed substantially to environmental footprints in some studies. Vegetarian and vegan diets may deliver larger environmental benefits, but are unlikely to be widely adopted, and may reduce intakes and/or bioavailability of some essential nutrients (e.g. iron, zinc, iodine and B12). We recommend adherence to existing government dietary guidelines as a more realistic goal to improve environmental (e.g. 30\% lower GHGE in the UK) and health impacts of diets, recognising that adherence is currently relatively poor. Wider considerations include: context-specific nutritional, health, cost and cultural needs; need for public engagement to understand barriers/motivators; better understanding of the wider implications and trade-offs linked to dietary and food system changes and how these can be managed, so that benefits in high-income countries do not come at the expense of greater `outsourced' environmental impacts in other regions.},

Consumer associations and some manufacturers are supporting the Nutri-Score, a summary, graded, colours-coded front-of-pack label (FoPL) adopted by public health authorities in France, Belgium and Spain. The Nutri-Score is using a Nutrient Profiling System (NPS) to define five different categories of nutritional quality (from `Dark green' associated with the letter A to `dark orange' with an E). The ability of the Nutri-Score to discriminate nutritional quality of foods was demonstrated in the French context. The objectives of this study were to verify its ability to discriminate the nutritional quality of foods and beverages currently present on the market in Germany and its consistency with German Food-Based Dietary Guidelines (FBDG). Nutritional composition of 8587 usual foods available on the German market collected from the web-based collaborative project Open Food Facts, were retrieved. Data were collected from 2012 to 2019, with regular updates each time a product is scanned again by a contributor. Distribution of products across the five Nutri-Score categories according to consumer-based food groups was assessed. The ability of the FoPL to discriminate the nutritional quality of foods and beverages was estimated by the number of available colours of the Nutri-Score in each food group and sub-groups. Overall, the classification of foods according to the Nutri-Score was consistent with German FBDG: foods which consumption is recommended were more favourably classified (e.g. 79.7\% of products composed mainly of fruits and vegetables were classified as A or B) than foods which consumption should be limited (e.g. 93.4\% of sugary snacks were classified as D or E). Moreover, we observed that the nutrient profiling system underpinning the Nutri-Score was able to display the variability in nutritional quality of foods within the same food groups, with good discriminating performance (at least three colours represented with the Nutri-Score). The Nutri-Score label displays a high ability in discriminating nutritional quality of foods across food groups and within a food group in the German market. This element is a key step in the validation process of a front-of-pack label, so that the Nutri-Score is an efficient tool which could help German consumers to make healthier choices.},

Using predefined cut points, those with poor nutrition literacy consumed more foods associated with the Western diet (fried foods, sugar-sweetened beverages, red meat, processed foods) while those with good nutrition literacy consumed more foods associated with prudent and Mediterranean diets (vegetables, olive oil, nuts).Conclusions: Nutrition literacy predicted adherence to healthy/unhealthy diet patterns.

Results Frequent home-cooked dinners were associated with being married, unemployed, larger households, presence of children aged \textexclamdown 12 years, and lower frequency of eating out, but unrelated to education or income. In adjusted models, frequent at-home cooking was associated with higher HEI-2010 ({$\beta$}=7.4, p\textexclamdown 0.001), whereas frequent eating out was associated with lower HEI-2010 ({$\beta$}= \textendash 6.6, p\textexclamdown 0.001). Frequent home cooking was linked with reduced per capita food expenditures overall (330/month among low vs 273/month among high cooking group, p\textexclamdown 0.001), and reduced away-from-home expenditures (133 and 65, respectively), without any significant increase in at-home food expenditures. However, frequent eating out was associated with significantly higher per capita food expenditures overall (261 in low vs 364 among high eating out group, p=0.001), and higher away-from-home expenditures. Conclusions Home-cooked dinners were associated with greater dietary guideline compliance, without significant increase in food expenditures.

To achieve this, however, we need to understand how healthy recommendations are and the factors which influence this. Focusing on two approaches from the literature (single item and daily meal plan recommendation) and utilizing a large Internet sourced dataset from Allrecipes.com, we show how algorithmic solutions relate to the healthiness of the underlying recipe collection. First, we analyze the healthiness of Allrecipes.com recipes using nutritional standards from the World Health Organisation and the United Kingdom Food Standards Agency. Second, we investigate user interaction patterns and how these relate to the healthiness of recipes. Third, we experiment with both recommendation approaches. Our results indicate that overall the recipes in the collection are quite unhealthy, but this varies across categories on the website. Users in general tend to interact most often with the least healthy recipes. Recommender algorithms tend to score popular items highly and thus on average promote unhealthy items. This can be tempered, however, with simple post-filtering approaches, which we show by experiment are better suited to some algorithms than others. Similarly, we show that the generation of meal plans can dramatically increase the number of healthy options open to users. One of the main findings is, nevertheless, that the utility of both approaches is strongly restricted by the recipe collection. Based on our findings we draw conclusions how researchers should attempt to make food recommendation systems promote healthy nutrition.},

  abstract = {A government's response to increasing incidence of lifestyle-related illnesses, such as obesity, has been to encourage people to cook for themselves. The healthiness of home cooking will, nevertheless, depend on what people cook and how they cook it. In this article, one common source of cooking inspiration-Internet-sourced recipes-is investigated in depth. The energy and macronutrient content of 5,237 main meal recipes from the food website Allrecipes.com are compared with those of 100 main meal recipes from five bestselling cookery books from popular celebrity chefs and 100 ready meals from the three leading UK supermarkets. The comparison is made using nutritional guidelines published by the World Health Organization and the UK Food Standards Agency. The main conclusions drawn from our analyses are that Internet recipes sourced from Allrecipes.com are less healthy than TV chef recipes and ready meals from leading UK supermarkets. Only 6 out of 5,237 Internet recipes fully complied with the WHO recommendations. Internet recipes were more likely to meet the WHO guidelines for protein than other classes of meal (10.88 v 7\% (TV), p\textexclamdown 0.01; 10.86 v 9\% (ready), p\textexclamdown 0.01). However, the Internet recipes were less likely to meet the criteria for fat (14.28 v 24 (TV) v 37\% (ready); p\textexclamdown 0.01), saturated fat (25.05 v 33 (TV) v 34\% (ready); p\textexclamdown 0.01), and fiber (compared to ready meals 16.50 v 56\%; p\textexclamdown 0.01). More Internet recipes met the criteria for sodium density than ready meals (19.63 v 4\%; p\textexclamdown 0.01), but fewer than the TV chef meals (19.32 v 36\%; p\textexclamdown 0.01). For sugar, no differences between Internet recipes and TV chef recipes were observed (81.1 v 81\% (TV); p = 0.86), although Internet recipes were less likely to meet the sugar criteria than ready meals (81.1 v 83\% (ready); p\textexclamdown 0.01). Repeating the analyses for each year of available data shows that the results are very stable over time.},

In this work we investigate the relationships between the online traces left behind by users of a large US online food community and the prevalence of obesity in 47 states and 311 counties in the US. Using data associated with the recipes bookmarked over an 9-year period by 144,839 users of the Allrecipes.com food website residing throughout the US, several hierarchical regression models are created to (i) shed light on these relations and (ii) establish their magnitude. The results of our analysis provide strong evidence that bookmarking activities on recipes in online food communities can provide a signal allowing food and health related issues, such as obesity to be better understood and monitored. We discover that higher fat and sugar content in bookmarked recipes is associated with higher rates of obesity. The dataset is complicated, but strong temporal and geographical trends are identifiable. We show the importance of accounting for these trends in the modeling process.},

  abstract = {Consuming a healthy diet can help individuals achieve and maintain a healthy weight, reduce the risk of developing chronic diseases, and promote good health. Research in the field of nutrition often focuses on single nutrients, foods, and/or food groups. While looking at components of the diet individually is important to examine the effects of various aspects of the diet on health, foods and nutrients are eaten in a variety of combinations and can have interactive and potentially cumulative or confounding relationships. Thus, when developing guidance on the types of foods, beverages, and nutrients to consume, it is important to consider research on individual components of the diet, as well as research that examines dietary patterns. For the purpose of this systematic review project, a dietary pattern is defined as the quantities, proportions, variety, or combination of different foods, drinks, and nutrients (when available) in diets, and the frequency with which they are habitually consumed. As noted in the 2010 Dietary Guidelines for Americans,1 there are several ways that a healthy diet can be achieved. The purpose of this project was to examine the relationship between dietary patterns and outcomes of public health concern.},

Our objective was to assess young college students diet and nutrient intake in relation to national dietary recommendations and assess the probability of inadequate micronutrient intake for both genders using the Nordic Nutrition Recommendations, and also to evaluate its consequences on preconception health and create a groundwork for future interventions on this group. At the University of Agder (UiA), we enrolled 622 students aged 18 40 years for a cross-sectional study of student s diet, StudentKost. The students completed a food frequency questionnaire, including questions of supplement use, over the past 4 weeks. Intake of fruits, vegetables, oily fish, and whole grain was lower than recommended, as were mean intake of folate, iron, and iodine. Our main findings are that students have a somewhat suboptimal diet compared to the Norwegian dietary guidelines. Male students had generally lower diet quality than females. Compared to the Nordic Nutrition Recommendations (NNR), we also saw a relatively high probability of inadequate intake of several micronutrients and a very high probability for some micronutrients in a significant portion of the sample. Public health effort should be directed towards improving students and young adults diet in general, and interventions towards improving preconception health should be explored. The low participation rate limits the generalizability of our findings. Our findings encourage further investigation into young adults diet.},

Both are, however, water-intensive products, with a large water footprint (WF) per unit of mass and protein and already today contribute to blue water stress in different parts of the world. The envisaged massive required increase in nut production to feed a global population with this reference diet, needs to occur in a water-sustainable way. In this paper, we identify and quantify where current nut production contributes to local blue water stress and discuss options for water-sustainable nut production. We show that 74\% of irrigated nuts are produced under blue water stress (of which 63\% under severe water stress), throughout many regions of the world, most notably in India, China, Pakistan, the Middle East, the Mediterranean region and the USA. We critically evaluate which nut types to promote given substantial differences in WFs. We propose sustainable intensification of nut production employing nut-specific WF benchmarks. We also recommend integrated water resources management including maximum sustainable levels of water consumption by setting of WF caps.},

Increasing evidence indicates that it is possible to develop diets that are both environmentally sustainable and healthy, but their potential success largely depends on consumers' willingness and ability to change their behavior. This study investigates consumer perceptions of the match, or mismatch, between healthy and sustainable diets, and gives insight into consumers' motivation to eat healthily and sustainably, as measured by involvement. Data were collected in Spring 2014 through a cross-sectional quantitative online survey with samples representative for age, gender and region in four European Union (EU) countries (United Kingdom, Germany, Belgium, and the Netherlands) (n = 2783). The images of a healthy diet, a sustainable diet and a plant-based diet were found to be highly compatible based on a strongly observed match between European consumers' perceptions of these concepts. Half of the participants were highly involved in healthy eating and one third in both healthy and sustainable eating. Informational food policy actions targeting both healthy and sustainable food consumption behavior are recommended to address issues relevant to the target segments, taking into account their levels of involvement. Increasing consumers' motivation and involvement in health and sustainability emerges as a key trigger for increasing healthy and sustainable eating.},

Design: For products within the product groups Cheese, Ready meals, Soups and Meal sauces, nutritional data from three large national retailers was collected and the products' corresponding Nutri-Scores were calculated. The distribution of the products among the different Nutri-Scores (A-E) per product group was calculated. To determine whether the healthiness of products correspond to a healthy score (A/B) and unhealthy products correspond to an unhealthy score (D/E), all product scores were compared to product group-specific criteria of the Dutch Choices Foundation. Furthermore, to identify whether there was a correlation between Nutri-Score and one or more nutrient(s), single and multiple regression analyses were performed. Finally, the Nutri-Score of products was compared with Dutch dietary guidelines. Data characteristics: 2299 products were included in this study, of which 1396 cheeses, 343 ready meals, 370 soups and 190 meal sauces. Results and conclusions: The current study shows that for the product groups Cheese, Ready meals, Soups and Meal sauces, there is an uneven distribution of the products among the different Nutri-Scores, Nutri-Scores of a great amount of products are not in line with Dutch Choices criteria and-dietary guidelines and there is no high correlation between Nutri-Score and health influencing nutrients in most product groups. Now that the Dutch Government has decided to implement Nutri-Score as the new FOP-label, it is advised to look into the possibilities to adapt the algorithm behind the score to a product group-specific algorithm based on Dutch guidelines.},

Three segments were identified: a pro-self, an average and a sustainable conscious segment. Synergy between perceptions of healthiness and sustainability differed across segments.

However, many results have been inconclusive and, to our knowledge, there has been no attempt to systematically capture the breadth of outcomes associated with dietary fiber intake or to systematically assess the quality and the strength of the evidence on the associations of dietary fiber intake and different health outcomes or medical conditions. Objective: The aim of this study was to describe the diverse health outcomes convincingly associated with dietary fiber consumption. Design: This was an umbrella review of systematic reviews with meta-analysis of observational studies. For each association, random-effects summary effect size, 95\% CIs, and 95\% prediction intervals were estimated. We also assessed heterogeneity, evidence for small-study effect, and evidence for excess significance bias. We used these metrics to evaluate the credibility of the identified evidence. Results: Our literature search identified 1351 abstracts. Of these, 18 meta-analyses including a total of 298 prospective observational studies and 21 outcomes were included. Outcomes studied included cancer and precancer lesions (n~=~12), cardiovascular diseases (CVDs; n~=~3), all-cause and specific-cause mortality (n~=~4), type 2 diabetes (n~=~1), and Crohn disease (n~=~1). Overall, 6 (29\%) of the 21 eligible outcomes reported highly significant summary results (P~{$<~$}1~\texttimes ~10-6); these included CVD and CVD mortality, coronary artery disease, pancreatic cancer, and gastric cancer. Overall, 3 of 21 (14\%) outcomes presented convincing evidence (pancreatic cancer, CVD mortality, and all-cause mortality), but only CVD and all-cause mortality were based on prospective studies. Two other outcomes (10\%), CVD and coronary artery disease, presented highly suggestive evidence based on prospective studies. Conclusion: Our results support dietary recommendations that promote higher fiber intake as part of a healthy diet.},

Design: Cross-sectional survey administered via Qualtrics among 18-75-year-old participants in the UK. The sample was stratified by age and gender with quotas defined according to the 2011 UK census distribution. Setting: Qualtrics' Online panel of respondents in the UK. Participants: 676 participants comprising nearly an equal number of females (n 341) and males (n 335) and a majority (58.6 \%) from households whose income was \textexclamdown\textsterling 30 000. Results: Our findings showed that nearly 40 \% of respondents were exposed to some or a lot of CNI. We found that while exposure to CNI from TV and online news increased nutrition confusion, CNI from health professionals increased backlash. Exposure to CNI from social media and health websites was associated with reduced backlash. We also found that nutrition confusion and backlash were negatively associated with exercise behaviour and fruit and vegetable consumption, respectively. Conclusions: Our study supports the theoretical pathways that explain the influence of CNI exposure on nutrition-related cognitive and behavioural outcomes. Additionally, different types of online information sources are associated with these outcomes to varying degrees. In the context of obesity and diabetes rates in the UK, our findings call for (a) further experimental research into the effects of CNI on consumers' diet-related cognitions and behaviours and (b) multi-stakeholder, interdisciplinary approaches to address this problem.},

Although the primary aim of the Consultation was to set targets related to diet and nutrition, the importance of physical activity was also emphasized. The Consultation considered diet in the context of the macro-economic implications of public health recommendations on agriculture and the global supply and demand for fresh and processed foodstuffs. In setting out ways to decrease the burden of chronic diseases such as obesity, type 2 diabetes, cardiovascular diseases (including hypertension and stroke), cancer, dental diseases and osteoporosis, this report proposes that nutrition should be placed at the forefront of public health policies and programmes. This report will be of interest to policy-makers and public health professionals alike, in a wide range of disciplines including nutrition, general medicine and gerontology.

Analysis of what we know of the origins of 10 tropical and 15 temperate infectious diseases reveals that animals were the source of the majority of important human diseases in the recent past, and that direct contact with animals through activities such as hunting remains a major route for disease acquisition. Modern developments such as industrial food production, vaccine production and blood transfusion may be making us more vulnerable than ever to new pathogens. The authors argue that people with high exposure to wild animals, such as hunters, zoo workers and wildlife veterinarians, should be regularly screened for emergent pathogens.This would provide early warning of newly introduced disease, and supply a repository of tissue samples that would assist in reconstructing the origin of later outbreaks. Many of the major human infectious diseases, including some now confined to humans and absent from animals, are `new' ones that arose only after the origins of agriculture. Where did they come from? Why are they overwhelmingly of Old World origins? Here we show that answers to these questions are different for tropical and temperate diseases; for instance, in the relative importance of domestic animals and wild primates as sources. We identify five intermediate stages through which a pathogen exclusively infecting animals may become transformed into a pathogen exclusively infecting humans. We propose an initiative to resolve disputed origins of major diseases, and a global early warning system to monitor pathogens infecting individuals exposed to wild animals.},

  abstract = {The improvement in iodine status among the UK population from the 1930s onwards has been described as an `accidental public health triumph' despite the lack of any iodine fortification program. However, iodine deficiency in the UK has re-emerged in vulnerable groups and is likely due to a combination of changing farming practices, dietary preferences and public health priorities. The UK is now among only a minority of European countries with no legislative framework for iodine fortification. The experience of folic acid fortification and the 28-year delay in its implementation lays bare the political difficulties of introducing any fortification program in the UK. If iodine fortification is not an imminent possibility, then it is important to explore other options: how to change farming practice especially on organic farms; encourage dairy intake; protect and expand our public health programs of milk provision for vulnerable groups and embark on education programs for women of childbearing potential and healthcare professionals. This review explores how the UK may have arrived at this juncture and how the iodine status of the nation may be improved at this time of major political and public health upheaval.},
