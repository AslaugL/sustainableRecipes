Recipes could potentially influence dietary intake, but little is known about their healthiness or environmental impact. We analyzed 600 recipes from Norway, the United Kingdom (UK) and the United States of America (US) and explored their healthiness by looking at their adherence to dietary guideline’s macronutrient recommendations and how well they performed on front-of-pack labels to guide consumers to make healthier food choices, in addition to their environmental impact. Results showed that recipe healthiness was influenced by the healthiness indicator used, with more than 70% of recipes being classified as healthy with at least one front-of-pack label, but less than one percent complied with all dietary guidelines criteria. All healthiness indicators were positively correlated with each other, and negatively correlated with environmental impact. Recipes from the US, that used more red meat, had higher environmental impact than recipes from Norway and the UK. 


Unhealthy diets that lead to malnutrition are believed to be responsible for one in five adult deaths and 15% of the total adult disability adjusted life years [@Afshin2019]. At the same time, our current food system is taking its toll on the environment. Globally, food production accounts for 70% of fresh water resources [@Shukla2019](p5), 42-61% of land resources [@Shukla2019](p6) and 21-37% of total greenhouse gas emissions (GHGE) [@Crippa2021]. Additionally there is growing awareness of how food production can negatively impact biodiversity, increase soil degradation and pollute air, water and land [@Benton2021; @RodriguezEugenio2018; @Domingo2021; @Kopittke2019]. This is the background for the need to develop diets that are both healthy and environmentally sustainable, so called "Sustainable Healthy Diets". The World Health Organization (WHO) and the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO) defines a sustainable healthy diet as a diet that: "promote all dimensions of individuals' health and well being; have low environmental pressure and impact; are accessible, affordable, safe and equitable; and are culturally acceptable." [@FoodandAgricultureOrganizationoftheUnitedNations2019].

Around the world, many countries and regions have developed food based dietary guidelines (FBDGs) that promote healthy dietary patterns [@Herforth2019]. These guidelines share similarities such as recommending a high quality whole foods diet with a variety of fruit and vegetables and other fibre rich foods such as whole grain cereals, legumes and nuts, and consuming high quality protein from fish, dairy and lean meats. Specific food recommendations are sometimes paired with quantitative advise such as number of portions in a day/week and serving sizes, to ensure that the public are aware of how much of the food to consume in a healthy diet. In recent updates of their FBDGs several countries, among them Sweden [@SwedishFood], Denmark [@Fødevarestyrelsen] and Qatar [@Seed2015], have included advise on how to eat not only for individual health, but also in an environmentally sustainable manner. This advise emphasizes the importance of following a diet rich in whole grain cereals, legumes, nuts, seeds, fruit and vegetables as these foods generally have a low environmental impact per kilo produced, while recommending a low to moderate amount of animal sourced foods that have a higher environmental impact and are not required in high amounts in the diet due to their nutrient density. 

Several studies have found the adherence to FBDGs to be low, especially when it comes to intake of foods that are promoted in FBDGs such as fruit and vegetables, legumes, whole grain cereals, nuts, fish and dairy, and unhealthy foods high in sugar, salt and/or saturated fat [@Leme2021]. At a global level, intake of meat is also higher than what is necessary for good health [@Leme2021]. These consumption patterns are negatively influencing both our health and our environment.

An interesting source of information that could influence individual's food choices is recipes. Analysis of specific food and nutrient content in recipes have previously been suggested as a way to follow food trends and dietary patterns in a population [@Buisman2019; @Eidner2013], and to monitor the relationship between food consumption and health [@Trattner2017b]. This could also be true for environmental impact. Recipes could be a less resource intensive method to gather dietary information than typically used food-frequency questionnaires, dietary interviews or food diaries, and provide a large source of food combinations used by consumers that could be used to find food combination that are both healthy and environmentally sustainable.

To date, several studies on recipes from different sources including cookbooks [@Irwin2017; @Howard2012; @Jones2013], supermarket magazines [@Wademan2020], food blogs [@Schneider2013; @Keogh2019; @Dickinson2018] and other Internet recipe sites [@Trattner2017a; @Jones2013; @Cheng2021] have found that recipes rarely comply with healthy dietary principles, and this is suggested to contribute to poor dietary habits. Less is known about the environmental impact of recipes. 

In this study we aimed to explore the healthiness and environmental impact of a selection of recipes from the United Kingdom (UK), Norway and the United States of America (US), from cookbooks (UK) and the Internet (Norway, US), and compare two domains of sustainable diets, namely health and environmental impact. To build on previous research on recipe's healthiness, micronutrient content will also be included in the analyses. The following research questions are asked:

1: How well do recipes from Norway, the UK and the US comply with healthy dietary guideline principles?

2: To what extent does a recipe's healthiness and environmental impact depend on country of origin?

3: To what extent does environmental impact correlate with healthiness?

## Results

### Data completeness

Of the 600 recipes in the dataset, 586 recipes were included in the analyses. One Norwegian recipe was excluded from analysis as it contained no ingredients for which the amount in weight could be obtained. This was a recipe for "Fresh mackerel". Five additional Norwegian recipes were excluded as they were not dinner recipes.

Eight recipes (six Norwegian, two US) were not included in the analysis as \>10% of their ingredients in weight could not be mapped to the nutrient or SHARP Indicators database. The ingredients that contributed to this were sheep head, marrow bones, fish bones, bananas, plantains, pure gluten flour and tamarind juice, ingredients which would be expected to impact either the health or environmental sustainability outcomes.

### Recipe healthiness, environmental impact and nutrient content

Recipes scored better on the front of pack labeling criteria than the dietary guidelines. Only 0.5% recipes complied with all six WHO guidelines and 0.9% complied with all NNR guidelines, while 70.7% received an inverted Nutriscore \> -2 and 98.6% scored \>7 on the inverted FSA MTL.

Of the total 35 nutrients, healthiness and environmental sustainability indicators assessed, 21 were significantly different (BH adjusted *p*-value \<0.05) between at least two countries in the Kruskal-Wallis test, so a *post-hoc* Dunn test was performed.

Recipes from the UK scored significantly better than recipes from Norway (BH adjusted *p*-value \<0.01) and the US (BH adjusted *p*-value \<0.001) on the NNR guidelines and the inverted Nutriscore (BH adjusted *p*-value \<0.05). Norway scored significantly better than the US recipes in the inverted multiple traffic light model and the NNR guidelines (BH adjusted *p*-value \<0.05).

Few recipes complied with WHO and NNR guideline criteria for carbohydrates, but more were compliant with NNR than WHO criteria. In a similar manner, more recipes were compliant with protein and total fat recommendations of the NNR than WHO. For dietary fibre, saturated fat and added sugar the guideline recommendations are identical. Protein contributed most to the qualifying scores on the Nutriscore, with the median score for protein being higher than the total median score of the disqualifying components. The scores for each component of the healthiness indicators by country, see **Figure** \@ref(fig:raw-score-guidelines), **Figure** \@ref(fig:raw-score-nutriscore) and **Figure** \@ref(fig:raw-score-trafficlights) for the guidelines, Nutriscore and the MTL respectively.

The US recipes had significantly higher CO~2~ emissions than recipes from both the UK (BH adjusted *p*-value \<0.01) and Norway (BH adjusted *p*-value \<0.05), and this was also the case for land requirements (BH adjusted *p*-value \<0.01).

In terms of individual nutrients, the UK recipes were significantly higher in dietary fibre and vitamin C than both the US and Norwegian recipes (BH adjusted *p*-value \<0.001 and \<0.01 respectively) and significantly lower than the US recipes in protein content (BH adjusted *p*-value \<0.05). Norwegian recipes were significantly higher in vitamin B12 than both the US and the UK (BH adjusted *p*-value \<0.05). While there were other statistically significantly different micronutrients, in absolute numbers the difference between countries were negligible.

### Protein sources used

Red meat (beef, lamb, game and pork) were the most used sources of protein in the recipes from all countries, while seafood (lean fish, oily fish and shellfish) were the second most used in the recipes from the UK and Norway and white meat (poultry) the second most used in the recipes from the US. Few recipes were vegan, and the UK had the most vegetarian recipes (**Figure** \@ref(fig:protein-sources-article) A). Per 100 grams, recipes from the US had the most meat and meat based products **Figure** \@ref(fig:protein-sources-article) B).

Depending on protein source, the GHGE and landuse for the recipes varied. Recipes with beef, lamb, game and shellfish had the highest environmental impact. Vegetarian and vegan recipes had the lowest environmental impact. Recipes with pork, poultry, lean and oily fish were in between. The vegetarian recipes with the highest impact were on level with the non-ruminant meat based recipes and the lowest ruminant meat recipes (**Figure** \@ref(fig:protein-sources-article) C).

```{r protein-sources-article, fig.cap = "A) Percentage of recipes that used various animal protein sources, or were vegan or vegetarian. b) Percentage in weight of meat or meat based products in recipes that contained meat. C) Environmental impact of recipes depending on protein source used, in kilo CO2 equivalents and m2.", out.width="100%"}

### Correlation between healthiness indicators and environmental impact indicators

Results from the Spearman correlation showed a significant (BH adjusted *p*-value \<0.001) positive correlation between the four healthiness indicators. There was a moderate correlation between the two front of pack labels (rho 0.64, BH adjusted *p*-value \<0.001), and a strong correlation between the two dietary guidelines (rho 0.78, BH adjusted *p*-value \<0.001), while the correlation between the front of pack labels and the dietary guidelines were weaker. The two sustainability indicators had a significantly strong positive correlation (BH adjusted *p*-value \<0.001).

All four healthiness indicators were significantly (BH adjusted *p*-value \<0.001) negatively correlated with the two environmental sustainability indicators, with the two dietary guidelines being more strongly correlated with both GHGE and landuse than the FSA MTL and Nutriscore were. NNR had a slightly stronger correlation with both GHGE and landuse than WHO guidelines, while the Nutriscore had a weaker correlation with landuse than the FSA MTL. See **Figure** \@ref(fig:Correlation-healthVSsustainability-article).

### Correlation between individual nutrients and environmental impact

Many individual nutrients were significantly correlated with environmental impact. Nutrients found exclusively in plants like carbohydrates, dietary fibre and the pre-vitamin A beta-carotene had a weak negative correlation with environmental impact. Carbohydrates had the strongest correlation of these nutrients. Animal sourced vitamin A retinol and saturated fat had a weak positive correlation with environmental impact, with saturated fat being more strongly correlated with environmental impact than retinol. The nutrients protein, iron and zinc that can be found in both plant-based foods and animal sourced foods were positively correlated with environmental impact. The strength of the correlation for all nutrients varied between countries (**Figure** \@ref(fig:Correlation-selected-nutrients-article)).

## Discussion

The purpose of this study was to explore the sustainability of dinner recipes, by looking at recipes healthiness and environmental impact and possible correlations between the two, and to see to which extent this varied by country of origin.

The results show that the healthiness of recipes depend on the healthiness indicator used, as recipes scored more favorably on the front of pack labels FSA MTL and Nutriscore, used to nudge consumers to make healthy food choices, than dietary guideline macronutrient criteria that have been used in previous studies on recipe healthiness [@Howard2012; @Jones2013; @Schneider2013; @Keogh2019; @Dickinson2018; @Trattner2017a; @Cheng2021]. Recipes from the US scored significantly worse on all four healthiness indicators than recipes from either Norway or the UK, and also had significantly higher environmental impact than recipes from the other two countries. Nutrients predominantly or exclusively found in plant-based foods were negatively correlated with environmental impact, while the opposite was true for nutrients predominantly found in animal sourced foods. While there were statistically significant differences between countries on the total score of the healthiness indicators, the absolute differences were small and are unlikely to have clinical relevance.

### Healthiness and environmental impact

In line with previous studies on recipe healthiness, the recipes in this study showed low compliance to dietary guideline macronutrient criteria from the WHO [@Howard2012; @Jones2013; @Schneider2013; @Keogh2019; @Dickinson2018; @Trattner2017a; @Cheng2021]. Recipes scored slightly better on the NNR criteria that allow for more fat and protein and less carbohydrates than the WHO criteria. In contrast, nearly all recipes were considered as a food that could be eaten "most of the time" when using the FSA MTL criteria, and about ~70% of recipes were considered healthy according to the Nutriscore criteria. This is different than a previous study that used the FSA MTL and found that few recipes were healthy [@Dickinson2018], but they used a more stringent criteria for defining a recipe as "healthy", requiring two greens and two amber lights and not three amber and one red as used in this study. The FSA states that a food with "mostly amber lights" can be eaten "most of the time", suggesting that consumers would see this food as healthy. Other studies that have used MTLs have used the Australian Live Lighter MTL [@Wademan2020] that has more stringent nutrient criteria than the FSA MTL, and the Australian Healthy Eating Advisory Service [@Irwin2017], which is also different than the FSA MTL as it varies depending on the type of food, including different types of dinner main and side dishes. To our knowledge no previous study has used the Nutriscore to assess a recipe's healthiness. The use of many different measurements with different interpretations make it difficult to compare results across studies.

Despite the different results on the different healthiness indicators, they were all positively correlated with each other and negatively correlated with environmental impact, indicating that they pick up on similar properties in the recipes.

The two dietary guidelines had a slightly stronger positive correlation with environmental impact than the two front of pack labels. This is likely due to differences in design between the two types of criteria, particularly how nutrients predominantly found in either plant-based or animal sourced foods are scored.

The guidelines reward a moderate-to-high content of carbohydrates and a high content of dietary fibre, both nutrients found in low environmental impact foods such as grains, legumes, tubers and fruit. At the same time, a high content of protein and saturated fat, both nutrients found predominantly in high environmental impact foods of animal origin, are penalized. Neither the FSA MTL or the Nutriscore rewards total carbohydrate intake, but the Nutriscore reward dietary fibre. This means the Nutriscore reward some plant-based foods, but not as many as the dietary guideline criteria. Both the FSA MTL and the Nutriscore penalize a higher content of saturated fat, but neither penalize a high protein content. Instead, protein is a qualifying component in the Nutriscore with no upper limit. Effectively this means the two front of pack labels nudge consumers towards leaner dairy products or cuts of meat, foods that are encouraged in many FBDGs but still have a relatively high environmental impact. This is especially true of the Nutriscore.

These differences likely comes from the different purposes of dietary guidelines and front of pack labels. Dietary guidelines are designed to be used to measure the nutrient quality of whole diets, not single meals as the foods in that meal is complemented by other foods consumed throughout the day. On the other hand, front of pack labels are designed to provide at-a-glance information about a specific food product, and help consumers make the healthier choice. Several studies have found that foods that score A/B on the Nutriscore are foods that are encouraged in FBDGs, and that if consumers choose these foods, dietary quality is likely to improve [@Ahmed2020; @Chantal2015; @SzabodeEdelenyi2019; @Dreano-Trecant2020], although for combination dishes such as ready meals that are comparable to the dinner recipes in this study, the alignment with dietary guidelines have been found to be lower than for other food categories [@Ahmed2020; @VanTongeren2020]. The different strengths of correlation between healthiness and environmental impact in the different countries indicate that different food combinations can provide the same healthiness score at different costs to the environment.

FBDGs from all three countries have specific recommendations for certain food groups. These include recommendations to choose whole grain products instead of refined grains, chose lean animal sourced  foods, consume at least "five a day" of fruit and vegetables and consume seafood throughout the week [@norskekostraad; @USdietaryguidelines2020; @NHSfood]. These foods are recommended as they contribute important nutrients to the diet. The Nutriscore is the only one of the healthiness indicators used that reward specific foods that FBDGs encourage an increased intake of, in this case fruits, vegetables, legumes, nuts and the oils olive oil, walnut oil and rapeseed oil.

Few recipes included whole grain ingredients, and few recipes had high scores for fruit, vegetable, legume and nut content on the Nutriscore. This is unfortunate as these foods have consistently been associated with improved health [@Afshin2019]. Few recipes included lean fish, one of the few dietary sources of this mineral [@NorwegianFoodSafetyAuthority2020]. If the low use of lean fish as an ingredient in this sample is reflective of dinner recipes from these sources overall, it is unfortunate as mild to moderate iodine deficiency could be a problem for vulnerable groups, especially pregnant women, in all the three countries the recipes are sourced from [@Meltzer2016; @Woodside2021; @Panth2019]. Fish and seafood are nutrient dense foods that, like whole grains and vegetables, are associated with improved health [@Mendivil2021]. The environmental impact from the recipes that used fish as a source of protein in this study also show that fish dinners have a relatively low environmental impact.

Interestingly, the recipes from the US that were significantly higher in environmental impact than recipes from Norway and the UK, had a higher proportion of red meat as a protein source, and used a higher amount of meat and meat based products. This is similar to how the proportion of red meat and total amount of meat could explain most of the the variance in the environmental impact of European diets [@Mertens2019a], and highlights that recipes can be used to find dietary trends that can influence environmental impact of diets. Both Norway and the UK recommend to keep red meat intake <500 grams/week in their FBDGs, while the US has no such recommendation [@norskekostraad; @USdietaryguidelines2020; @NHSfood]. Of recipes that used red meat as a source of protein, pork recipes had the lowest environmental impact. 

### Nutrient content and environmental impact

A diet is not sustainable if it cannot provide the nutrients needed to promote an individual's health and wellbeing, but at the same time the foods that provide the required nutrients should not put undue strain on the environment.

Nutrients found exclusively in plant based foods, including carbohydrates, dietary fibre and beta-carotene were negatively correlated with environmental impact, while the opposite was true for nutrients found predominantly or exclusively in animal sourced foods such as saturated fat and retinol. For nutrients that can be found in both plant-based and animal sourced foods, such as iron and zinc, the correlation with environmental impact was weaker for recipes from the UK, possibly because they contained more of these nutrients from plant-based sources. This shows that it is possible to find food combinations that provide required nutrients at a lower environmental cost. However, these results must be interpreted with caution as the bioavailability of these nutrients vary depending on source, with plant-based sources of iron and zinc having a lower bioavailability than animal sources [@Helsedirektoratet2014].

In a recent modelling study by Perignon et al. [@Perignon2016], moderate GHGE reductions from diet (defined as $\leq$ 30%) were possible without compromising nutrient adequacy.

### Strengths, limitations and future work

To our knowledge, this is the first study to explore environmental impact of recipes from either the Internet or recipe books, the first study explore at the healthiness of recipes from Norwegian Internet recipe sites, and the first study on healthiness of recipes to use the NNR and Nutriscore and include a wide range of micronutrients. The healthiness indicators are used in many different countries, making the results of the healthiness and correlation analyses applicable outside of the countries of origin of the recipes included. All analyses and ingredient-to-database mapping are available as R scripts, and can easily be reproduced.

A limitation of the data used is the discovery that several online recipes would include additional ingredients in their description to be served with the recipe, and these ingredients were not listed in the ingredients list used in the analyses. For example "serve with potatoes, rice or salad". These are ingredients that would have altered the healthiness scores and lowered the environmental impact of a recipe, by providing more carbohydrate and/or fibre rich foods. The recipes from the UK were from celebrity chef's recipe books, which could possibly be different than UK recipes found online.

Healthiness, nutrient content and environmental impact were calculated per 100 grams which may have limited the useability of the results, as portion sizes are likely more than 100 grams. Standardizing per 100 grams was done because not all recipes provided number of servings, and the Nutriscore is calculated based on values per 100 grams. Further studies should see if differences in portion size could contribute to differences in healthiness and environmental impact of recipes between countries.

The difference in healthiness of the recipes based on the healthiness indicator used suggest further studies should aim to find the most suitable healthiness indicator for recipes. The Nutriscore is advantageous as it is made to be used on single food products comparable to a recipe, balances healthy and unhealthy nutrients in a food, and reward the inclusion of foods recommended in FBDGs. The disadvantage is that it is more difficult to compute.

### Conclusion

This study has shown that the type of measurement used to calculate healthiness can influence if a recipe is classified as healthy or not, and that there were few differences between recipe healthiness, nutrient content, CO~2~ emission and landuse and country of origin, but recipes from the US had significantly higher environmental impact than recipes from the other countries. Recipes scored worse on adherence to WHO and Nordic Nutritional Recommendation dietary guidelines on macronutrient intake than on the front of pack labels the UK's Food Standard Agency Multiple Traffic Light system and the Nutriscore. For all four healthiness indicators there was a negative correlation with environmental impact, with a stronger correlation being found between dietary guidelines and environmental impact than between the front of pack labels and environmental impact. Nutrients predominantly found in animal sourced foods were positively correlated with environmental impact, while nutrients found in plant-based foods were negatively correlated with environmental impact. It was also found that few recipes were either vegetarian, vegan, or included whole grains or seafood, even though all countries of origin encourage the intake of plant-based foods, whole grains and seafood in their food based dietary guidelines.

## Methods

### Data

To assess the association between different recipes, healthiness of the recipes and their environmental impact, 400 recipes from Norway, and 100 from each of the UK and the US were analysed.

Recipes from Norway and the US came from a database of online recipes collected previously. A randomized selection of these recipes had been chosen for nutritional analyses previously [@Trattner2017] and were reused for this study Recipes came from Klikk.no (n = 100), Tine.no (n = 100), Aperitif.no (n = 100), Kolonial.no (n = 100) (Norway) and Allrecipes.com (n = 100) (US). Since recipe collection Kolonial has been renamed Oda. The UK recipes came from a random selection from an assortment of UK celebrity chef's recipe books previously used to study the healthiness of television chef's recipes [@Howard2012], Baking Made Easy (n = 7), River Cottage Everyday (n = 21), Jamie's Ministry of Food (n = 22), Jamie's 30 Minute Meals (n = 25) and Nigella's Kitchen (n = 25). A list of all the recipe names and their sources is provided in the supplementary material.

### Calculating nutritional content and environmental impact of recipes

The nutrient content of the recipes were calculated by mapping the ingredients from each recipe to the 2020 Norwegian Food Composition Database [@NorwegianFoodSafetyAuthority2020], that contains information about the macro- and micronutrient content per 100 g of commonly consumed foods in Norway. If an ingredient in a recipe was not in the Norwegian database, the US equivalent, Agricultural Research Service FoodData Central food database [@foodDataCentral2019], was used.

To calculate a recipe's environmental impact, the public SHARP Indicators Database that include greenhouse gas emissions (in kilo CO~2~ equivalents) and land use (in m^2^ pr year) of ~900 foods was used [@Mertens2019]. The environmental impact in the database comes from life-cycle inventory data on 182 primary products, and many composite foods based on these primary products. These LCAs included the environmental impacts of primary production of the food, and the impact of its packaging, transport to supermarket/consumer, storage at the supermarket/consumer, final preparation and any waste produced throughout.

Standardized weight measures from the "Weights, measures and portion sizes for foods" database from The Norwegian Directorate of Health [@ØsterholtDalane2015] were used to calculate the weight of ingredients with volume units. If the ingredient was not in this database the U.S. Department of Agriculture, Agricultural Research Service FoodData Central food database [@foodDataCentral2019] was used, the ingredient was found in the online shops of Meny, Kolonial or COOP, or measured at home. For composite ingredients, a recipe was found through an online search, similar to how the inventors of the SHARP Indicator database looked up composite foods [@Mertens2019] and calculated separately before being added back to the original recipe.

All values were normalized to per 100 g of the recipe.

### Recipe healthiness

Four indicators were used to assess each recipe's healthiness: the dietary gudelines from the WHO [@WHOdietaryguidelines] and the Nordic Nutrition Recommendations (NNR), and the front of pack nutrition labeling systems the UK Food Standard Agency's Multiple Traffic Light (FSA MTL) [@BritishNutritionFoundation2019] and the French Nutriscore [@NutriscoreGuidelines]. 

The two dietary guidelines define macronutrient ranges for daily diets. Similar to Howard et al. [@Howard2012], a health score was created based on the ranger for the nutrients carbohydrates, sugar, dietary fibre, fat, saturated fat and protein, giving a score between 0-6 where 0 is unhealthy and 6 is healthy. 

The FSA MTL includes the four macronutrients salt, fat, saturated fat and sugar. These nutrients are graded "green"/"low", "amber/"medium" and "red"/"high". A score of 3 was awarded for "green", 2 for "amber" and 1 for "red", giving a range between 4-12 where a higher score equals a healthier food. This is an inversion of the scoring system used by Howard et al. [@Howard2012], to be in line with the dietary guidelines where a higher score indicates a more healthy food. According to the FSA, a food can be eaten most of the time if it has a majority of amber lights, which equals to a score of >7. The Nutriscore was calculated as per the guideline documentation [@NutriscoreGuidelines], but an inverted score was used to be in line with the other indicators where a higher score means a more healthy food. An inverted score of >-2 was chosen as the cut-off for a food that could be eaten often as part of a healthy diet, as this had previously been used to assess the alignment between the Nutriscore and national dietary guidelines [@Ahmed2020].

### Statistical analysis

#### Missing data

Ingredients with no amounts were replaced with the mean value of that ingredient in all other recipes, normalized to per 100 g of the recipe. If this was not possible, ingredients were left out of the analyses. Ingredients that could not be found in the nutrient or sustainability databases were if possible exchanged for a similar ingredient, or left out. If more than 10% of the recipe in weight could not be mapped to either the food composition table or SHARP Indicators database, the recipe was left out.

#### Significant differences between countries

Significant differences in energy per 100 g, macronutrient content in percentage of energy, micronutrient content in percentage of the RDI of an adult woman in Norway [@Helsedirektoratet2014], healthiness indicator scores and sustainability indicators between recipes from the different countries were assessed using the Kruskal-Wallis test. A Dunn's test was performed *post-hoc*, and to account for multiple testing the Benjamini Hochberg (BH) method was used.

All tests were done using the rstatix package v. 0.7.0 [@Kassambara2021].

#### Correlation analysis

To explore possible correlation between variables Spearman's rho were calculated using the Psych library v. 2.1.6 [@Raiche2013] corr.test function. This was done for the recipes from each country individually and for the pooled data from all countries. P-values were calculated and corrected for multiple testing using the BH method.

For all analyses, an adjusted *p*-value \< 0.05 was considered significant.
