# Discussion

The purpose of this thesis was to explore the healthiness and environmental impact of recipes found on Internet recipe sites or in recipe books, from three different countries, and to see if origin country influenced a recipe's healthiness or environmental impact, in addition to the correlation between a recipe's healthiness and environmental impact. To our knowledge, this is the first study to look at environmental impact of recipes from either the Internet or recipe books, the first study to look at the healthiness of recipes from Norwegian Internet recipe sites, and the first study on healthiness of recipes to use the NNR and Nutriscore and include a wide range of micronutrients.

## Healthiness and environmental impact

In line with previous studies on recipe healthiness that looked at compliance with the macronutrient requirements from dietary guidelines [@Howard2012; @Jones2013; @Schneider2013; @Keogh2019; @Dickinson2018; @Trattner2017a; @Cheng2021], the results from this thesis showed that only a small percentage of recipes were compliant. The macronutrient content of the Norwegian dinner recipes varied slightly from a previous study of the nutrient content of Norwegian dinners, based on data from the Norwegian national diet survey Norkost 3 that was performed in 2010/2011 [@Myhre2016]. Compared to dinners in Norkost 3, the Norwegian recipes in this thesis had a lower E% from carbohydrates and added sugar, a higher E% of total fat, while the E% from saturated fat and protein and the amount of dietary fibre were similar. This could suggest that in the recipes ingredients that contribute to carbohydrate content have been exchanged for ingredients that contribute fat, specifically unsaturated fats as there were little difference in saturated fat content. A possible explanation could be that the recipes from Norway are of a newer date, and follows the trend of a decreased E% from carbohydrate and increased E% from fat that has been seen in Norwegian diets since Norkost 3 was performed [@Helsedirektoratet2021a\] (p37). This pattern of decreased intake of carbohydrates and increased intake of fat has also been observed in US consumers \[@Shan2019].

Fewer recipes were compliant with the WHO than the NNR guidelines, that allows for less carbohydrates and more fat. When looking at the front of pack labels, the MTL and the Nutriscore, the majority of recipes were classified as foods that could be consumed most of the time as part of a healthy diet. That the front of pack labels showed that most recipes could be consumed often, while the same recipes were not compliant with the dietary guidelines, is likely due to the different design and purpose of these indicators, that will be discussed in more detail later. There were statistically significant differences between countries on the total score of the healthiness indicators, but these differences are deemed to be of low clinical relevance.

The FSA MTL findings from this thesis are different than other studies that have used a traffic light system to classify recipes and found that their nutritional qualities are low [@Dickinson2018; @Irwin2017; @Wademan2020]. This is likely due to a difference in interpretation of the FSA MTL, and the use of other traffic light systems with different threshold values for nutrients and different interpretations of the traffic light colors. Dickinson et al. [@Dickinson2018] found that recipes on clean eating blogs did not comply well with WHO criteria, and that this was reflected in the recipes also having amber-red lights on the FSA MTL. However, in the guide to interpretation of the FSA MTL [@BritishNutritionFoundation2019], it is said that a food that has mostly amber colored lights can be eaten "most of the time", which suggests it is not unhealthy. In line with this, a recipe that had mostly amber lights, which could mean three amber and one red light, were not considered unhealthy in this thesis. Irwin et al. [@Irwin2017] found that few recipes were healthy when using the Australian Healthy Eating Advisory Service traffic light system (HEAS) where an amber light does not mean "can be eaten most of the time" as in the FSA MTL, but rather "consume in moderation" [@HEAStrafficlights]. The same is true for the study by Wademan et al. [@Wademan2020] that used the Australian LiveLighter traffic light system (LL), where amber means the food is "okay sometimes". Additionally the Australian LiveLighter traffic light system also has more stringent nutrients criteria than the FSA MTL, with the amber criteria from FSA overlapping with the red criteria from the LL. If this is true for the HEAS as well is difficult to say as in contrast to the FSA MTL and the LL criteria, the HEAS varies depending on the type of food, including different types of dinner main and side dishes.

That the UK recipes had lower environmental impact than recipes from the US and Norway is in line with their lower amounts of the high environmental impact ingredient meat from ruminants, and high to medium amounts of low environmental impact ingredients such as vegetables including roots and tubers, fruits, grains, legumes and nuts.

This also likely explains why the UK recipes scored slightly better on the Nutriscore, that awards high content of vegetables, fruits and dietary fibre, in addition to protein.

Without portion sizes it is difficult to say how much of the RDI of a given nutrient a serving would have provided. Whether this would be adequate or not would also depend on the rest of the diet. Regardless, a conservative standard dinner serving size of about 350 grams raw weight would contribute substantially to vitamin B12 intake, but also vitamin B6, niacin, vitamin A, zinc, selenium and copper. The generally low amount of iodine reflects that few recipes included white lean fish, one of the few dietary sources of this mineral \[@NorwegianFoodSafetyAuthority2020\]. If the low use of lean fish as an ingredient in this sample is reflective of dinner recipes from these sources overall, it is unfortunate as mild to moderate iodine deficiency could be a problem for vulnerable groups, especially pregnant women, in the three countries the recipes are sourced from \[@Meltzer2016; @Woodside2021; @Panth2019\].

For the Norwegian recipes, the percentage of recipes with fish is in line with the national FBDG, that advises consumption of at least two-three fish dinners a week, corresponding to 28-43% of dinners. The ratio between lean and oily fish, about 1:1, is also in line with the guidelines [@norskekostraad]. For the UK recipes the percentage of recipes is below the recommended two portions of fish a week [@fishNHS], but also for the UK recipes the ratio between lean and oily fish is in line with guideline recommendations of 1:1. Unlike the Norwegian and UK FBDGs, the US FBDG do not give specific advice for fish intake, but rather group fish and shellfish together into a seafood category and advice an intake of 8 ounces/week [@USdietaryguidelines2020], corresponding to 1.2-1.7 portions from the UK or Norway. It should be mentioned that for lean fish, there is no upper limit on intake in any of the FBDGs. In contrast, both Norway and the UK advice that intake of red meat should be \<500 g/week, which corresponds to two-three dinners and some meat based cold-cuts according to the Norwegian FBDG [@norskekostraad]. The US FBDG does not have individual guidelines for red meat intake.

While many nutrients in the recipes were statistically significantly different between countries, the differences were not clinically relevant, at least per 100 g of the recipes. The lower amount of protein, and higher amount of dietary fibre and vitamin C in the UK recipes are in agreement with the lower amount of meat products that are high in protein, and higher amount of vegetables and fruit that are sources of dietary fibre and vitamin C, in these recipes.

That the different types of healthiness indicators classified foods differently, and that the guidelines were more strongly correlated with environmental impact than the MTL and the Nutriscore, with the Nutriscore having the lowest correlation with environmental impact, is not very surprising due to the way these scores are designed.

### Differences between the front of pack labeling schemes and the dietary guidelines

Dietary guidelines for nutrient intake are designed to to be used to assess the nutrient quality of whole diets, not single meals. On the other hand, the MTL and the Nutriscore is designed to provide at-a-glance information about a specific product and help consumers make healthier food choices. That particular food by itself does not necessarily comply with all dietary guidelines, but by consistently buying the recommended foods within a varied set of food groups, dietary quality is likely to improve. The Nutriscore have consistently been shown to give A/B scores for foods which are encouraged in food based dietary guidelines [@Ahmed2020; @Chantal2015; @SzabodeEdelenyi2019; @Dreano-Trecant2020], although for combination dishes such as ready meals that are comparable to the dinner recipes in this study, the alignment with dietary guidelines have been found to be lower than for other food categories [@Ahmed2020; @VanTongeren2020]. Unlike the other three indicators, the Nutriscore balance unhealthy disqualifying components of a food with healthy qualifying components. This means a food product can receive a healthy label if the score on the qualifying components outweigh the score of disqualifying components, that by themselves could make a food product be labeled unhealthy with any of the other indicators.

While the recipes defined as healthy or a meal that could be eaten often as part of a healthy diet varied between the indicators, the positive correlation between the indicators indicate that they pick up on similar nutrient qualities in the recipes.

The differences between how the scores are calculated also likely explain why the dietary guidelines had a stronger correlation with environmental impact than the MTL and the Nutriscore. All the healthiness indicators penalize a high content of saturated fats, found almost exclusively in high environmental impact animal sourced foods, but also a few vegetable fats such as coconut and palm oil [@NorwegianFoodSafetyAuthority2020]. All but the MTL reward higher dietary fibre content, found in low environmental foods such as whole grains, fruits and vegetables including starchy roots and tubers, legumes and nuts. The most important difference is likely between how total carbohydrates and protein content is scored. The dietary guidelines reward a moderate to high total carbohydrate content and penalize too high protein content, while Nutriscore does not include total carbohydrates and protein is a qualifying component of the score with no upper limit penalty.

Effectively this means recipes with a higher score on the dietary guidelines would have a higher content of low environmental impact foods such as starchy roots and tubers, grains, legumes and fruit, rich in total carbohydrates, while penalizing those recipes that contained a high amount of high environmental impact meat that is rich in protein. On the other hand, a recipe with a high score on the Nutriscore could still include high amounts of meat, as long as it was a cut low in saturated fat, which would give these recipes a higher environmental impact. For the specific recipes in this study, the median qualifying score from protein alone outweighed or neutralized the median disqualifying scores on the Nutriscore.

As the MTL does not provide boundaries for either carbohydrates, fibre or protein content, a higher score is not as tied to a high content of low environmental ingredients as the dietary guidelines, but it is neither associated with a higher content of high environmental ingredients that could happen with the Nutriscore.

Surprisingly, adherence to the NNR guidelines, with its lower carbohydrate and higher fat allowances, was slightly stronger correlated to reduced environmental impact than adherence to the WHO guidelines. This could be because more recipes were awarded points for carbohydrate content with NNR than WHO guidelines. That more recipes also received points for protein content is not as important as the general protein content of the recipes was relatively high, and

The difference healthiness scores between the guidelines, and between dietary guidelines and food-specific indicators, could be important for designing future studies on the healthiness of recipes.

### Nutrient content and environmental impact

Nutrients found in high amounts in animal sourced foods, like saturated fat, protein, iron, zinc, phosphorus, retinol, vitamin B12 and riboflavin were the nutrients that were positively correlated with environmental impact. Interestingly, this varied a little by country. For zinc and iron, the correlation with GHGE were lower in the UK recipes than recipes from Norway and the US, suggesting that more zinc and iron in the UK recipes came from plant based foods rather than animal sourced foods with a higher environmental impact. While iron were significantly higher in the UK than the Norwegian recipes, this difference was clinically irrelevant. For zinc there were no significant difference between countries. While the UK recipes provided more iron and zinc at a lower environmental cost, these minerals have lower bioavailability when they come from plant based sources rather than animal sourced foods and can not be directly compared [@Platel2016]. There are however ways to increase the bioavailability of the nutrients in plants, such as soaking, sprouting and combining plants with different nutrients that improve absorption, for example plant-based iron is easier absorbed if consumed together with an acid like vitamin C. For vitamin B12 and protein, the correlation was stronger for GHGE than landuse, likely due to these nutrients being provided not only by meat but also seafood that has a lower land requirement than meat, but could still have the same GHGE in the SHARP database. This could also explain the different strength of the correlation of the individual countries, as different types of seafood were used in the recipes from each country.

For the nutrients vitamin D and iodine, there was a negative correlation with landuse but not GHGE. This is also likely due to these nutrients mainly being found in seafood.

For nutrients found exclusively in plants, such as beta-carotene, vitamin C (**can be found in animal's adrenal glands**), carbohydrates and fibre (**can be found in insects and shrimp/prawns**) there was a negative correlation with environmental impact. This was also the case for folate, but to a lesser extent. Likely because folate is not exclusive to plants but can also be found in animal sourced foods, like liver and eggs. For sugar, which is also a plant based food, there was a positive correlation with both GHGE and landuse. This is likely an artifact due to sugar being used in marinades or sauces in meat based recipes.

That important micronutrients were positively correlated with GHGE and landuse, underscore the importance of including micronutrient content when planning low GHGE diets. The association between these nutrients and GHGE is likely the reason why in studies on self-selected diets, low GHGE does not always align with higher nutritional quality [@Anitha2021; @Masset2014]. In a recent modelling study by Perignon et al. [@Perignon2016], moderate GHGE reductions (defined as ≤ 30%) were possible without compromising nutrient adequacy. Larger reductions were possible, but would require non-trivial changes in food consumption patterns.

Recipe sources with weekly menu plans, not just individual meals, could possibly be used for further studies on nutritional adequacy and environmental impact of diets. By using recipe sources that provide information on cost and/or has rating systems that could be used as a proxy for acceptability, all four domains of sustainable diets could be explored.

## Limitations and strengths

There are several limitations of the data and methods used in this thesis. It was discovered that some online recipes would include additional ingredients in their description to be served with the recipe, not included in the ingredients list that had been added to the database used to calculate nutrient content and environmental impact. For example "serve with potatoes, rice or salad". These are ingredients that would have altered the healthiness scores and lowered the environmental impact, by providing more carbohydrate and/or fibre rich foods, had they been included in the analyses. This could possibly explain why recipes from the UK, which were from chef's recipe books and possibly were more detailed, performed better on the healthiness indicators. Future studies that base their analyses on online recipes should take this into account and not solely rely on collected ingredient lists that may be lacking. Another issue with the online recipes were that not all recipes were classified correctly by meal type, as both desert, lunch and appetizers were found classified as dinner recipes.

Some ingredients that contributed to the nutrient calculations, and thus influenced healthiness scores, were not ingredients that would be eaten in full in the final recipe. For example oil in marinades or vegetables is soup bases. This is only relevant for the healthiness, and not environmental impact, as the environmental impact of these ingredients are the same regardless of if they are eaten or not. The final weight of soups, stews and recipes with certain sauces are likely inflated due to the inclusion of high amounts of water, that would have diluted the other ingredients when calculating nutrient content and environmental impact per 100 grams.

Analysing the nutrient content and environmental impact per 100 grams could limit the real world usefulness of the results, as a typical dinner is likely more than 100 grams. Using portion size could perhaps have been a better choice, but not all recipes provided the number of portions per recipe. This might have been solved by using standardised portion sizes of protein included in the recipe, but this approach does not take into account that portion sizes may vary by recipe, and this in itself could be a source of different nutrient content and environmental impact between different recipe sources. Since a typical daily menu would consist of multiple meals that complement each other, the specific nutrient content and/or environmental impact of a single meal in isolation is of limited interest. A daily or weekly menu plan could have provided more information about the nutritional adequacy and environmental impact of food combinations.

It is unfortunate the only environmental impact that was assessed were emissions in kilo CO~2~ equivalents, which included acidification, and land use. It would have been interesting to include different types of water use and indicators for how the ingredients influence biodiversity and pollution. The use of the SHARP database, that is based on LCAs from a handful of European countries, means that the results may not be relevant to inhabitants of the countries the recipes in this study comes from. Nutrient content in food composition databases may also not accurately depict the nutrient content of foods, which could influence results of nutrient content analyses.

There were also some strengths. The inclusion of other micronutrients than sodium is unique in the field of recipe healthiness, and the multiple healthiness indicators included are used in many different countries, making the results of the healthiness analyses applicable outside of the countries of origin of the recipes included. All analyses and ingredient-to-database mapping are available as R scripts, and can easily be reproduced.

## Conclusion

This thesis showed there were few differences between recipe healthiness, CO~2~ emission and landuse and country of origin. Recipes scored worse on adherence to WHO and Nordic Nutritional Recommendation dietary guidelines on macronutrient intake than on the front of pack labels the UK's Food Standard Agency Multiple Traffic Light system and the Nutriscore. For all four healthiness indicators there was a negative correlation with environmental impact, with a stronger correlation being found between dietary guidelines and environmental impact than between the front of pack labels and environmental impact. The weakest correlation was found with the Nutriscore. Nutrients predominantly found in animal sourced foods, including protein, vitamin B12, retinol, iron and zinc, were positively correlated with environmental impact, while nutrients found in plant based foods, including carbohydrates, fibre and vitamin C, were negatively correlated with environmental impact. It was also found that few recipes were either vegetarian, vegan, or used seafood as a source of protein, even though all countries of origin encourage a high intake of plant based foods and seafood in their food based dietary guidelines.
