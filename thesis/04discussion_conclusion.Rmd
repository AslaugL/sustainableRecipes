## Choosing ingredients with low environmental impact

## Low environmental impact, high nutritional value

-   Indias water stress could be reduced by swapping rice with other cereals, this could also improve nutrition status as cereals such as millet, sorghum and wheat have more iron

-   Mekonnen et al. found that if Americans change their diet to be in line with the American dietary guidelines, it will increase the water footprint of the diet by about 7% despite a lower intake of meat. However, if American shifted to a vegetarian or vegan diet it could reduce the water footprint by 20% and 37% respectively [@Mekonnen2018]. At the same time they found that if food waste was eliminated, the water footprint of the current American diet could be reduced by 49%, 12% more than changing to a vegan diet. It is interesting to note that the blue water increased for both vegetarian and vegan diets, and that the reduction in water footprint came from a lower use of green water. Another study by Tom et al. found that if calories were kept the same, a change in food consumption of Americans to be in line with their dietary guidelines would lead to an increase in energy use by 43 %, blue water footprint by 16 %, and GHG emissions by 11 % [@Tom2015].

    -   Only a small amount of the water footprint of animals comes from drinking and serving water, while 98% comes from the growing of their feed [@Mekonnen2012]. Ruminant animals that can eat roughage has a lower blue water footprint than non-ruminants that feed on crops
    -   While 98% of the water footprint of animals comes from the growing of their feed, less than 14% of the water footprint from crops is for feed crops [@Mekonnen2011] \#Check reference.

-   While ruminants can be fed roughage that are not edible for humans, non-ruminant (pork, chicken and farmed fish) feed consists of cereals that could feed humans [@Makkar2018].

    -   Producing one kilo bone free meat of non ruminants uses more human edible crops than one kilo of bone free meat from ruminants, sans in intensive cattle feedlot systems [@Mottet2017] \#Read study again, a lot of information

    -   57% of the land used in animal production for feed cannot be used for other food production [@Mottet2017].

-   The blue water footprint of food is more important than green water, as it competes with other blue water demands. It is also important to look at grey water (pollution from runoff). While the average total water footprint of beef is higher than that of pork and chicken, the average blue and gray water footprint is similar. If the cattle is allowed to graze, the blue and gray water footprint of beef is less than that of pork and chicken [@Gerbens-Leenes2013]

-   Fresh water, which is a limited resource many places in the world is believed to be even more scarce in the face of climate change [@UnitedNationsWater2019].

It is possible to produce food in a more sustainable manner. For example for ruminant meat, mitigation strategies for GHGE include the use of pasture and grazing techniques that improve soil carbon sequestration [@Godde2020; @Willett2019; @Byrnes2018; @Cusack2021; @DeFigueiredo2017]. In some studies it is even shown that grazing management could lead to net negative carbon emissions of the livestock at farm level [@Stanley2018; @Viglizzo2019; @Salvador2017; @Gutierrez-Pena2019]. Finding sustainable ways to keep ruminants is especially important in countries such as Norway where only three percent of the land is used as farmland, and an even smaller area can be used for crops fit for human consumption [@Knutsen2020]. Norway also has an abundance of green water [@Schyns2019], which is the main source of water for grazing cattle.

When it comes to plants, locally field grown products are the most sustainable. There are possible strategies to improve field growing even further, such as intercropping or a rotating crop system. Intercropping, growing two or more crops in close proximity such as legumes and oats [@Tidaker2021] or lettuce and cucumbers [@Pereira2021], could reduce GHGE of both species. Introducing legumes in a rotating crop system reduce the subsequent crop's need for fertilizer [@Nemecek2008; @Costa2020]. This could decrease climate impact by 12-21% [@Tidaker2021]. However, field growing is not always possible due to seasonal climate, and the use of heated greenhouses can increase GHGE of a fruit or vegetable substantially. In such cases, importing the produce from a region where it is in season might be the better option. Tomatoes, aubergine, peppers and cucumbers grown locally in a heated greenhouse could have up to a 100 times the GHGE than if they had been imported from a country where they are in season and grown in fields [@Theurl2014; @Frankowska2019; @Davis2011; @Ntinas2017]. It is however important to think about how the produce is transported. For example long haul air-freighting of peas into UK from non European countries has nearly 59 times higher GHGE than the use of heavy goods vehicles to transport peas to UK from EU countries [@Michalsky2015].

Production of nuts has higher GHGE than cereals and legumes, but still considerably less than animal based foods. However there are limited studies on the GHGE of nut production [@Clune2017]. Besides GHGE, nuts have a large water footprint and 74 % of nuts produced today are produced under blue water stress, 63 % under severe water stress [@Vanham2020]. Per kilo produced, almonds, pistachios, hazelnuts and walnuts have the same water footprint as meat from beef [@Vanham2020].

For seafood, fish caught offshore by trawling or long line fishing has higher GHGE than fish caught closer to the coast [@Clune2017]. Lobsters, shrimp and prawn may under certain circumstances have as high an impact as ruminants, while pollock and herring on the other end is comparable to tree-nuts and cereals [@Clune2017]. The majority of marine fish comes from sustainable fished stocks without overfishing, but there are geographical differences [@FoodandAgricultureOrganizationoftheUnitedNations2020] (p7-8). About 50 % of seafood consumed globally comes from aquaculture, and production is expanding [@FoodandAgricultureOrganizationoftheUnitedNations2020] p6). Feed for aquaculture are primarily based on wild caught forage fish, and this has raised concerns about overfishing and the collapse of aquatic food webs [@Naylor2009]. Farming of Atlantic Salmon has especially high demands of marine feed sources [@Naylor2009]. Alternative feed sources are crops, but this will increase pressure on freshwater resources [@Pahlow2015], and compete with crop production for human consumption [@Makkar2018].
