# Discussion

The purpose of this thesis was to explore the healthiness and environmental impact of recipes found on Internet recipe sites or in recipe books, from three different countries, and to see if origin country influenced a recipe's healthiness or environmental impact, in addition to the correlation between a recipe's healthiness and environmental impact. To our knowledge, this is the first study to look at environmental impact of recipes from either the Internet or recipe books, the first study to look at the healthiness of recipes from Norwegian Internet recipe sites, and the first study on healthiness of recipes to include a wide range of micronutrients and to use the NNR and Nutriscore.

## Healthiness and environmental impact

In line with previous studies on recipe healthiness that looked at compliance with dietary guidelines [@Howard2012; @Jones2013; @Schneider2013; @Keogh2019; @Dickinson2018; @Trattner2017a; @Cheng2021], the results from this thesis showed that only a small percentage of recipes complied fully with dietary guidelines. There were fewer recipes that were compliant with the WHO than the NNR guidelines, that allows for less carbohydrates and more fat. When looking at the front of pack labels, the MTL and the Nutriscore, the majority of recipes were classified as foods that could be consumed most of the time as part of a healthy diet. That the front of pack labels showed that most recipes could be consumed often, while the same recipes were not compliant with the dietary guidelines, is likely due to the different design and purpose of these indicators, that will be discussed in more detail later. There were statistically significant differences between countries on the total score of the healthiness indicators, but these differences are deemed to be of low clinical relevance.

The MTL findings from this thesis are different than other studies that have used a traffic light system to classify recipes and found that their nutritional qualities are low [@Dickinson2018; @Irwin2017; @Wademan2020]. This is likely due to a difference in interpretation of the FSA MTL, and the use of other traffic light systems with different threshold values for nutrients and different interpretations of the traffic light colors. Dickinson et al. [@Dickinson2018] found that recipes on clean eating blogs did not comply well with WHO criteria, and that this was reflected in the recipes also having amber-red lights on the FSA MTL. In this thesis if a recipe had mostly amber, which could mean three amber and one red, were considered a food that could be eaten "most of the time". This is in line with the guidance provided by the FSA for interpretation of the amber colored lights [@BritishNutritionFoundation2019]. Irwin et al. [@Irwin2017] also found that few recipes were healthy when using the Australian Healthy Eating Advisory Service traffic light system where an amber light does not mean "can be eaten most of the time" as in the FSA MTL, but rather "consume in moderation" [@HEAStrafficlights]. The same is true for the study by Wademan et al. [@Wademan2020] that used the Australian LiveLighter traffic light system, where amber means the food is "okay sometimes". Additionally these traffic light systems also has more stringent nutrients criteria than the FSA MTL.

That the UK recipes had lower environmental impact than recipes from the US and Norway is in line with their lower amounts of the high environmental impact ingredient meat from ruminants, and high to medium amounts of low environmental impact ingredients such as vegetables including roots and tubers, fruits, grains, legumes and nuts. This also likely explains why the UK recipes scored slightly better on the Nutriscore, that awards high content of vegetables, fruits and dietary fibre, in addition to protein.

Without portion sizes it is difficult to say how much of the RDI of a given nutrient a serving would have provided. Whether this would be adequate or not would also depend on the rest of the diet. Regardless, a standard dinner serving size of about 350 grams raw weight would contribute substantially to vitamin B12 intake, but also vitamin B6, niacin, vitamin A, zinc, selenium and copper. The generally low amount of iodine reflects that few recipes included white lean fish, one of the few dietary sources of this mineral [@NorwegianFoodSafetyAuthority2020]. If the low use of lean fish as an ingredient in this sample is reflective of dinner recipes from these sources overall, it is unfortunate as mild to moderate iodine deficiency could be a problem for vulnerable groups, especially pregnant women, in the three countries the recipes are sourced from [@Meltzer2016; @Woodside2021; @Panth2019].

For the Norwegian recipes, the percentage of recipes with fish is in line with the national FBDG, that advises consumption of two-three fish dinners a week, corresponding to 28-43%. The ratio between lean and oily fish should be about 1:1 [@norskekostraad]. For the UK recipes the percentage of recipes is below the recommended two portions of fish a week [@fishNHS]. Also in the UK the ratio between lean and oily fish should be 1:1. Unlike the Norwegian and UK FBDGs, the US FBDG do not give specific advice for fish intake, but rather group fish and shellfish together into a seafood category an advice an intake of 8 ounces/week [@U.S.DepartmentofAgriculture2020], corresponding to 1.2-1.7 portions from the UK or Norway. It should be mentioned that for lean fish, there is no upper limit on intake in the FBDGs. In contrast, both Norway and the UK advice that intake of red meat should be \<500 g/week, corresponding to two-three dinners and some meat based cold-cuts according to the Norwegian FBDG [@norskekostraad]. The US FBDG does not have individual guidelines for red meat intake.

While many nutrients in the recipes were statistically significantly different between countries, the differences were not clinically relevant, at least per 100 g of the recipes. The lower amount of protein, and higher amount of dietary fibre and vitamin C in the UK recipes are in agreement with the lower amount of meat and higher amount of vegetables and fruit in these recipes.

That the different types of healthiness indicators classified foods differently, and that the guidelines were more strongly correlated with environmental impact than the MTL and the Nutriscore, with the Nutriscore having the lowest correlation with environmental impact, is not very surprising due to the way these scores are designed.

### Differences between the front of pack labeling schemes and the dietary guidelines

Dietary guidelines for nutrient intake are designed to to be used to assess the nutrient quality of whole diets, not single meals. On the other hand, the MTL and the Nutriscore is designed to provide at-a-glance information about a specific product and help consumers make healthier food choices. That particular food by itself does not necessarily comply with all dietary guidelines, but by consistently buying the recommended foods within a varied set of food groups, dietary quality is likely to improve. The Nutriscore have consistently been shown to give A/B scores for foods which are encouraged in food based dietary guidelines [@Ahmed2020; @Chantal2015; @SzabodeEdelenyi2019; @Dreano-Trecant2020], although for combination dishes such as ready meals that are comparable to the dinner recipes in this study, the alignment with dietary guidelines have been found to be lower than for other food categories [@Ahmed2020; @VanTongeren2020]. Unlike the other three indicators, the Nutriscore balance unhealthy disqualifying components of a food with healthy qualifying components. This means a food product can receive a healthy label if the score on the qualifying components outweigh the score of disqualifying components, that by themselves could make a food product be labeled unhealthy with any of the other indicators.

While the recipes defined as healthy or a meal that could be eaten often as part of a healthy diet varied between the indicators, the positive correlation between them indicate that they pick up on similar nutrient qualities in the recipes.

The differences between how the scores are calculated also likely explain why the dietary guidelines had a stronger correlation with environmental impact than the MTL and the Nutriscore. All the healthiness indicators penalize a high content of saturated fats, found almost exclusively in high environmental impact animal sourced foods, but also a few vegetable fats such as coconut and palm oil [@NorwegianFoodSafetyAuthority2020]. All but the MTL reward higher dietary fibre content, found in low environmental foods such as whole grains, fruits and vegetables including starchy roots and tubers, legumes and nuts. The most important difference is likely between how total carbohydrates and protein content is scored. The dietary guidelines reward a moderate to high total carbohydrate content and penalize too high protein content, while Nutriscore does not include total carbohydrates and protein is a qualifying component of the score with no upper limit penalty.

Effectively this means recipes with a higher score on the dietary guidelines would have a higher content of low environmental impact foods such as starchy roots and tubers, grains, legumes and fruit, rich in total carbohydrates, while penalizing those recipes that contained a high amount of high environmental impact meat that is rich in protein. On the other hand, a recipe with a high score on the Nutriscore could still include high amounts of meat, as long as it was a cut low in saturated fat, which would give these recipes a higher environmental impact. For the specific recipes in this study, the qualifying score from protein alone outweighed or neutralized the disqualifying scores on the Nutriscore.

As the MTL does not provide boundaries for either carbohydrates, fibre or protein content, a higher score is not as tied to a high content of low environmental ingredients as the dietary guidelines, but it is neither associated with a higher content of high environmental ingredients that could happen with the Nutriscore.

Surprisingly, adherence to the NNR guidelines, with its lower carbohydrate and higher fat allowances, was slightly stronger correlated to reduced environmental impact than adherence to the WHO guidelines. This could be because more recipes were awarded points for carbohydrate content with NNR than WHO guidelines.

The difference healthiness scores between the guidelines, and between dietary guidelines and food-specific indicators, could be important for designing future studies on the healthiness of recipes.

## Nutrient content and environmental impact

Not surprisingly, nutrients found in high amounts in animal sourced foods, like saturated fat, protein, iron, zinc, phosphorus, retinol, vitamin B12 and riboflavin were the nutrients that were positively correlated with environmental impact. Interestingly, this varied a little by country. For zinc and iron, the correlation with GHGE were lower in the UK recipes than recipes from Norway and the US, suggesting that more zinc and iron in the UK recipes came from plant based foods rather than animal sourced foods with a higher environmental impact. While iron were significantly higher in the UK than the Norwegian recipes, this difference was clinically irrelevant. For zinc there were no significant difference between countries. While the UK recipes provided more iron and zinc at a lower environmental cost, these minerals have lower bioavailability when they come from plant based sources rather than animal sourced foods and can not be directly compared [@Platel2016]. There are however ways to increase the bioavailability of the nutrients in plants, such as soaking, sprouting and combining plants with different nutrients that improve absorption, for example plant-based iron is easier absorbed if consumed together with an acid like vitamin C. For vitamin B12 and protein, the correlation was stronger for GHGE than landuse, likely due to these nutrients being provided by not only meat but also seafood that has a lower land requirement than meat, but could still have the same GHGE in the SHARP database. This could also explain the different correlation scores for the different countries, as different types of seafood are used in the recipes.

For the nutrients vitamin D and iodine, there was a negative correlation with landuse but not GHGE. This is also likely due to these nutrients being found in seafood.

For nutrients found exclusively in plants, such as beta-carotene, vitamin C (**can be found in animal's adrenal glands**), carbohydrates and fibre (**can be found in insects and shrimp/prawns**) there was not surprisingly a negative correlation with environmental impact. This was also the case for folate, but to a lesser extent. Likely because folate is not exclusive to plants but can also be found in animal sourced foods, like liver and eggs.

While increasing intake of plant based foods would lower environmental impact of our diets, substituting animal sourced foods for plant based alternatives could lead to nutrient deficiencies if the diet is not planned properly as not all plant based alternatives replace the nutrients found in animal sourced foods. Additionally plant based sources of vitamin A and the minerals iron, magnesium, zinc and to some extent calcium have lower bioavailability than their meat based counterparts [@Platel2016].

## Low environmental impact, but high nutritional value foods

There are room for improvements of the recipes at home to increase nutritional qualities while lowering environmental impact. As previously mentioned, a low intake of fruit, vegetables and whole grains are a

-   Low environmental impact, high nutritional value diets \> recipes can be improved at home

    -   Whole grains over rice. Local tubers instead of rice and pasta for dinner where applicable

    -   Vegetables, vegetables, vegetables

    -   Limit discretionary foods

    -   Consume adequate calories

    -   Reduce food waste

        -   Recipes can be a useful tool when meal planning, but can also contribute to food waste by making consumers buy products that are not needed in large amounts, where everything not used in the recipe eventually gets thrown away

## Limitations and strengths

There are several limitations of the data and methods used in this thesis. It was discovered that some online recipes would include additional ingredients in their description to be served with the recipe, not included in the ingredients list that had been added to the database used to calculate nutrient content and environmental impact. For example "serve with potatoes, rice or salad". These are ingredients that would have altered the healthiness scores and lowered the environmental impact, by providing more carbohydrate and/or fibre rich foods, had they been included in the analyses. This could possibly explain why recipes from the UK, which were from chef's recipe books and possibly were more detailed, performed better on the healthiness indicators. Future studies that base their analyses on online recipes should take this into account and not solely rely on collected ingredient lists that may be lacking. Another issue with the online recipes were that not all recipes were classified correctly by meal type, as both desert, lunch and appetizers were found classified as dinner recipes.

Some ingredients that contributed to the nutrient calculations, and thus influenced healthiness scores, were not ingredients that would be eaten in full in the final recipe. For example oil in marinades or vegetables is soup bases. This is only relevant for the healthiness, and not environmental impact, as the environmental impact of these ingredients are the same regardless of if they are eaten or not. The final weight of soups, stews and recipes with certain sauces are likely inflated due to the inclusion of high amounts of water, that would have diluted the other ingredients when calculating nutrient content and environmental impact per 100 g.

Using portion sizes instead of 100 g of a recipe to calculate nutrient content and environmental impact may have provided answers with more relevance to the real world, but many recipes did not contain this information.

The only environmental impact that was assessed were emissions in kilo CO~2~ equivalents, which included acidification, and land use. It would have been interesting to include different types of water use and indicators for how the ingredients influence biodiversity and pollution. The use of the SHARP database, that is based on LCAs from a handful of European countries, means that the results may not be relevant to inhabitants of the countries the recipes in this study comes from. Further, it was discovered during the calculation of nutrient content that the then downloadable version of Matvaretabellen [@NorwegianFoodSafetyAuthority2020] had switched the content in the columns for retinol and beta-carotene. This was quickly fixed, but illustrate that these databases are not infallible. Nutrient content in these databases may also not accurately depict the nutrient content of foods, which could influence results of nutrient content analyses.

There were also some strengths. The inclusion of other micronutrients than sodium is unique in the field of recipe healthiness, and the multiple healthiness indicators included are used in many different countries, so the results have a wide range. All analyses and ingredient-to-database mapping are available as R scripts, and can easily be reproduced.
