# Discussion

The purpose of this thesis was to explore the healthiness and environmental impact of recipes found on Internet recipe sites or in recipe books, from three different countries, and the correlation between a recipe's healthiness and environmental impact. To our knowledge, this is the first study to look at environmental impact of recipes from either the Internet or recipe books, the first study to look at the healthiness of recipes from Norwegian Internet recipe sites, and the first study on healthiness of recipes to include a wide range of micronutrients.

In line with previous studies on recipe healthiness, the results from this thesis showed that only a small percentage of recipes complied fully with dietary guidelines. There were fewer recipes that were compliant with the WHO than the NNR guidelines, that allows for less carbohydrates and more fat. However, when looking at the food-specific indicators for healthiness, the Multiple Traffic Light System and the Nutriscore, the majority of recipes classified as foods that could be consumed often as part of a healthy diet. That the food-specific indicators showed that most recipes could be consumed often, while the same recipes were not compliant with the dietary guidelines, is likely due to the different design and purpose of these indicators, that will be discussed later. There were statistically significant differences between countries on the total score of the healthiness indicators, but these differences are deemed to be of low clinical relevance. When looking at the individual components of the score, that the recipes from the UK scored better on vegetables, fruit and healthy sources of fat, in addition to being lower in meat, might indicate they are more beneficial for long-term health than the recipes sampled from Norway and the US. It also likely explains why the UK recipes scored better on the Nutriscore, that awards high content of vegetables, fruit and healthy sources of fats and dietary fibre.

Without portion sizes it is difficult to say how much of the RDI of a given nutrient a serving would have provided. Whether this would be adequate or not would also depend on the rest of the diet. Regardless, a standard dinner serving size of about 350 grams raw weight would contribute substantially to vitamin B12 intake, but also vitamin B6, niacin, vitamin A, zinc, selenium and copper. The generally low amount of iodine reflects that few recipes included white lean fish, one of the few dietary sources of this mineral [@Matvaretabellen2020]. If the low use of fish as an ingredient in this sample is reflective of dinner recipes from these sources overall, it is unfortunate as mild to moderate iodine deficiency could be a problem for vulnerable groups, especially pregnant women, in the three countries the recipes are sourced from [@Meltzer2016; @Woodside20201; @Panth2019]. Vitamin A was provided mostly from animal sources, in the form of retinol, than from plant based sources in the form of beta-carotene.

While many nutrients in the recipes were statistically significantly different between countries, the differences were not clinically relevant, at least per 100 g of the recipes. Again, if comparisons had been done per portion size this might have been different. The lower amount of protein, and higher amount of dietary fibre and vitamin C in the UK recipes are in agreement with the lower amount of meat and higher amount of vegetables and fruit in these recipes.

Recipes that complied with the two dietary guidelines were more strongly correlated with low environmental impact than recipes that complied with the multiple traffic light system or the Nutriscore.

That the different types of healthiness indicators classified foods differently, and that the guidelines were more strongly correlated with environmental impact than the multiple traffic light system and the Nutriscore, and that the Nutriscore had the lowest correlation with environmental impact, is not very surprising due to the way these scores are designed.

## Differences between the front of pack labeling schemes and the dietary guidelines

All of the healthiness indicators had upper limits for saturated fat content in the recipes, which is likely to effect recipes with a higher content of animal sourced foods as these are the primary sources of saturated fats. The dietary guidelines is different from the multiple traffic light system and the Nutriscore in that they award both carbohydrates and fibre content. This means recipes that contained foods such as fruit and vegetables, tubers, grains and legumes, with a low environmental impact, would get a higher score. On the other hand Nutriscore only awards fibre content, and high-carbohydrate low-fibre low-environmental impact foods such as rice and pasta would not give a better score. Additionally, the dietary guideline scores would punish high protein recipes, whereas there is no higher boundary for protein content in the Nutriscore. Nearly 50% of all recipes from the three countries had the highest score for protein in the Nutriscore, and this protein likely comes from animal based sources with a high environmental impact. The multiple traffic light system does not provide boundaries for either carbohydrates, fibre or protein content, so while a higher score is not associated with a higher content of low-environmental ingredients, it is neither associated with a higher content of high-environmental ingredients.

Surprisingly, adherence to the NNR guidelines, with its lower carbohydrate and higher fat allowances, was slightly stronger correlated to reduced environmental impact than adherence to the WHO guidelines. This could be because more recipes were awarded points for carbohydrate content with NNR than WHO.

The difference healthiness scores between the guidelines, and between dietary guidelines and food-specific indicators, could be important for designing future studies on the healthiness of recipes.

## Micronutrient content and environmental impact

For individual nutrients...

-   Vitamins and minerals found in seafood associated with lower land use, but not necessarily GHGE

-   Vitamins, minerals and macros found in plant based foods associated with lower environmental impact

-   Nutrients found in ruminants and animal sourced foods associated with higher environmental impact

-   Thiamine associated with lower CO2 but increased landuse? Grains? Pork?

-   Saturated fat comes mainly from animal sources, more or less exclusively for dinner recipes (exception palm oil and coconut oil)

## Making more sustainable choices

A study in Sweden found that if consumers reduced their meat intake to \<500 g/week in accordance with the Swedish FBDG,

Small changes in ingredients can have a huge impact on the sustainability of the resulting meal. A study done in the UK, found that if British consumers

When it comes to starchy staples in dinner recipes, such as potatoes, rice and pasta,

However, while GHGE and landuse decrease with reduced intake of animal sourced foods, this is not necessarily the case for blue water [@Harris2020].

-   Choosing ingredients with low environmental impact, consumers got some things right

    -   Plants, local when in season

    -   Seafood, with caveats

        -   Overfishing, farmed fish causes major environmental damage... While SHARP ID does not include land use for many marine fish species, this is not completely true

    -   Non-ruminants, with caveats

        -   Animal welfare issues, dependencies on grains for feed

    -   If eating ruminants, look for farms with grazing strategies that improve soil carbon sequestration, and other soil quality markers

        -   Ruminants are also important many places where human edible crops can't be grown and other animals will be unable to feed on what is found locally

    -   Low environmental impact food packaging

        -   Plastic has many advantages over glass and tin on the production and transportation side, but causes an enormous amount of environmental pollution

    -   Discuss how the ecoscore is calculated

        -   Takes most of what is discussed previously into account, in addition to biodiversity

### Low environmental impact, but high nutritional value

-   Low environmental impact, high nutritional value diets \> recipes can be improved at home

    -   Whole grains over rice. Local tubers instead of rice and pasta for dinner where applicable

    -   Vegetables, vegetables, vegetables

    -   Limit discretionary foods

    -   Consume adequate calories

    -   Reduce food waste

        -   Recipes can be a useful tool when meal planning, but can also contribute to food waste by making consumers buy products that are not needed in large amounts, where everything not used in the recipe eventually gets thrown away

## Limitations and strengths

There are several limitations of the data and methods used in this thesis. It was discovered that some online recipes would include additional ingredients in their description to be served with the recipe, not included in the ingredients list that had been added to the database used to calculate nutrient content and environmental impact. For example "serve with potatoes, rice or salad". These are ingredients that would have altered the healthiness scores and lowered the environmental impact, by providing more carbohydrate and/or fibre rich foods, had they been included in the analyses. This could possibly explain why recipes from the UK, which were from chef's recipe books and possibly were more detailed, performed better on the healthiness indicators. Future studies that base their analyses on online recipes should take this into account and not solely rely on collected ingredient lists that may be lacking. Another issue with the online recipes were that not all recipes were classified correctly by meal type, as both desert, lunch and appetizers were found classified as dinner recipes.

Some ingredients that contributed to the nutrient calculations, and thus influenced healthiness scores, were not ingredients that would be eaten in full in the final recipe. For example oil in marinades or vegetables is soup bases. This is only relevant for the healthiness, and not environmental impact, as the environmental impact of these ingredients are the same regardless of if they are eaten or not. The final weight of soups, stews and recipes with certain sauces are likely inflated due to the inclusion of high amounts of water, that would have diluted the other ingredients when calculating nutrient content and environmental impact per 100 g.

Using portion sizes instead of 100 g of a recipe to calculate nutrient content and environmental impact may have provided answers with more relevance to the real world, but many recipes did not contain this information.

The only environmental impact that was assessed were emissions in kilo CO~2~ equivalents, which included acidification, and land use. It would have been interesting to include different types of water use and indicators for how the ingredients influence biodiversity and pollution. The use of the SHARP database, that is based on LCAs from a handful of European countries, means that the results may not be relevant to inhabitants of the countries the recipes in this study comes from. Further, it was discovered during the calculation of nutrient content that the then downloadable version of Matvaretabellen [@NorwegianFoodSafetyAuthority2020] had switched the content in the columns for retinol and beta-carotene. This was quickly fixed, but illustrate that these databases are not infallible. Nutrient content in these databases may also not accurately depict the nutrient content of foods (**SOURCE**), which could influence results of nutrient content analyses.

There were also some strengths. The inclusion of other micronutrients than sodium is unique in the field of recipe healthiness, and the multiple healthiness indicators included are used in many different countries, so the results have a wide range. All analyses and ingredient-to-database mapping are available as R scripts, and can easily be reproduced.
