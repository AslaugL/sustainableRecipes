# Background

Not only are unhealthy diets that lead to malnutrition believed to be responsible for one in five adult deaths and 15% of the total adult disability adjusted life years globally [@Afshin2019], but our current food system, i.e. how we produce, distribute and process food items, is also taking its toll on the environment. Globally, food production accounts for 70% of fresh water resources [@Shukla2019](p5), 42-61% of land resources [@Shukla2019](p6) and 21-37% of total greenhouse gas emissions (GHGE) [@Crippa2021]. Additionally, there is growing awareness of how food production negatively impacts biodiversity, increases soil degradation and pollutes air, water and land [@Benton2021; @RodriguezEugenio2018; @Domingo2021; @Kopittke2019]. This is made even worse by the fact that about a third of all food produced in the world is either lost or wasted through the supply chain or at the consumer level. Food waste is the third largest contributor to the world's GHGEs [@FoodandAgricultureOrganizationoftheUnitedNations2013], and accounts for 23-24% of freshwater, land and fertilizer used in food production [@Kummu2012]. The EAT-Lancet Commission on Food, Planet, Health states that food production is the largest cause of global environmental change [@Willett2019]. With a growing human population, if current trends in production and consumption patterns continue, more people will end up malnourished and the stress on the environment will increase.

This is the background for the need to develop diets that are both healthy and environmentally sustainable, so called "Sustainable Healthy Diets". The World Health Organization (WHO) and the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO) define sustainable healthy diets as dietary patterns that "promote all dimensions of individuals' health and well being; have low environmental pressure and impact; are accessible, affordable, safe and equitable; and are culturally acceptable." [@FoodandAgricultureOrganizationoftheUnitedNations2019]

## The environmental impact of our food

An environmentally sustainable food system is defined by FAO as a system whose effects "on the surrounding natural environment are neutral or positive, taking into consideration biodiversity, water, soil, animal and plant health, the carbon footprint, the water footprint, food loss and waste, and toxicity." [@Food2018]

Most research that has been done on the environmental impact of different foods have focused on GHGE. Increased GHGE cause climate change, which with various degrees of certainty will result in sea level rise, ocean acidification, increased temperature and more extreme weather events such as floods and droughts [@masson-delmotteClimateChange20212021]. Among the many issues this can cause, is poorer yield and nutrition value of crops and livestock products, and in turn worse nutrition status of humans [@Hatfield2011; @Rojas-Downing2017]. It follows then that an unsustainable food system by itself can contribute to decreased food security in the future, that is the physical and economical access individuals have to nutritious and safe foods [@Shukla2019; @Gustafson2016].

The environmental impact of foods are commonly found through life cycle assessments (LCAs), a "compilation and evaluation of the inputs, outputs, and potential environmental impacts of a product system throughout its life cycle." [@Cucurachi2019] The input in an LCA for a food product could be the raw materials used to produce farm equipment, the energy source used for heating a greenhouse or powering a tractor, the resources used to make fertilizer or feed, and how the food is packaged, distributed, processed and finally how any waste produced is handled. The result is the environmental impact (GHGE, land use, water footprint, eutrophication, acidification and/or others) per output functional unit of the food. The functional unit varies, but could be the kilo of food produced at the farm, or that reaches the consumer. Other functional units used are amounts of energy, protein and various micronutrients produced, or hectares of land used to produce a given amount of product. There are no standardised method to perform an LCA of a food, so it can be difficult to compare results between studies that have performed LCAs with various inputs, outputs and assessment of different environmental impacts.

In general, production at the farm contributes the most to a food's environmental impact, while distribution, packaging, processing, preparation and waste removal is less important [@Crippa2021; @Ledgard2010; @EulalioNeto2021].

There are however huge variations both within and between the same foods and food groups (see **Figure** \@ref(fig:environmental-impacts)). Details such as geographical location and available local resources, seasonality, outdoor or indoor production system, energy sources used for production, type of fertilizer and/or pest control used for crops, herd size and type of breed of animals and type of feed used for animals can all influence the environmental impact of a given food. For example, vegetables produced locally may have lower environmental impact than imported produce when in season and grown in fields, but out of season the vegetables might be grown in heated greenhouses that have a higher environmental cost than transportation from a region where they are produced in season. A food could also be environmentally sustainable when looking at one type of environmental impact, but harmful when looking at another. For example, nuts have a high water footprint while their GHGE is relatively low.

```

### Difference between food groups

Multiple studies have found that industrial meat production from ruminants (beef, sheep) is the largest contributor to GHGE and land use in the agriculture sector [@Clune2017; @phelpsLandUseAnimal2017; @Mertens2019]. Per kilo produced, median GHGE from beef is 71 times higher than in season field grown vegetables, 53 times higher than cereals and legumes, 22 times higher than tree nuts, eight times higher than fish, seven times higher than chicken, five times higher than pork, three times higher than shrimps and prawns, and about similar to lamb [@Clune2017].

The situation is more nuanced when it comes to the water footprint. There are three types of water that must be taken into account when looking at the water footprint of a food, namely blue water (surface- and groundwater), green water (rainwater) and gray water (surface- and groundwater that has been polluted) [@Gerbens-Leenes2013]. Around the world, the availability of blue and green water varies [@Rosa2020; @Schyns2019], and depending on the region in which food is produced it may overtax available resources. While the global average total water footprint of beef per kilo produced is higher than for other animals (2.6 times more than pork, 3.6 times more than chicken [@Mekonnen2012]), if green water is excluded the water footprint of beef is similar to that of pork and chicken [@Gerbens-Leenes2013]. The global average total water footprint per kilo produced of beef is 21.8 times higher than vegetables, 9.4 times higher than cereals, 3.8 times higher than pulses and 1.7 times higher than nuts. When removing green water, beef has 5.4 times the water footprint of vegetables, 2.4 times the water footprint of cereals, about the same water footprint as pulses, and half the water footprint of nuts [@Mekonnen2011; @Mekonnen2012]. There is a lack of water footprint analyses of seafood, but aquaculture in China has been found to have a similar blue and green water footprint to global levels for chicken [@Gephart2017].

Of land used for agriculture, about 75% is used for pastures, while the remaining 25% is used for croplands [@Shukla2019](p6). The median area of land used to produce one kilo of fat and bone free meat of beef is 568 times higher than a kg of assorted vegetables, 30.4 times that of farmed fish, 19.6 times more than nuts, 15.5 times that of poultry, 14 times that of pulses, 12.7 that of pork and 1.3 times that of lamb [@Poore2018a].

Turning natural land into croplands or pasture is the principal cause of habitat loss for wild species, which in turn is associated with loss of biodiversity [@Benton2021]. The expanding use of natural lands by humans may lead to an increased exposure to infectious pathogens from animals, in the worst case leading to future pandemics [@Wilkinson2018; @Patz2004; @Wolfe2007; @Dobson2020]. Water used for farming also shunts water away from natural ecosystems. Runoff, excess nutrients from fertilizer, can cause overgrowth of algae in rivers and other water systems at the expense of other species in a process known as eutrophication. The use of pesticides to grow crops is also associated with loss of biodiversity [@Benton2021]. 

Organic farming practices have been shown to be less damaging to biodiversity than conventional farming, but produce lower yields so that per functional unit produced GHGE, water footprint and land use is higher [@Reganold2016]. However, concerns have been raised that typical LCAs fail to adequately assess the full environmental impact of organic farming, and that results may be to overestimate acidification, eutrophication and global warming potential while downplaying the benefits [@Meier2015].

It is important to note that looking at the environmental impact per kilo produced of a food does not take into account the amount and type of nutrients the food provides. A food could have a high environmental impact per kilo, but only be needed in small amounts to supply the necessary nutrients for good health, such as meat and dairy products. For these foods their high environmental impact per kilo may be at least partly offset by their nutrient density [@drewnowskiEnergyNutrientDensity2015]. Conversely, a food can have a low environmental impact per kilo but be of low nutrient quality, such as white sugar. 

Included in LCAs of livestock production, which also entails farmed seafood, is the environmental impact of growing feed. Currently, a third of all crops grown are used to feed livestock. While some argue these crops should be used to feed humans, only about 14% of the crops used to feed livestock are fit for human consumption [@mottetLivestockOurPlates2017]. Depending on type of lifestock, this number could be either increased or decreased. Non-ruminant (pork, poultry and farmed fish) feed consists of more human edible cereals than ruminant feed, as ruminants can be fed roughage that are not edible for humans [@Makkar2018; @Pahlow2015; @mottetLivestockOurPlates2017]. The rise of fish farming means that more crops will be grown for fish feed in the future, likely leading to an increase of farmed fish's water and land footprint [@Pahlow2015]. On the other hand, the increased use of crops in fish feed has come about in part due to overfishing of marine ingredients used in the feed, and the use of crops reduce the strain on these marine resources.

Additional concerns not mentioned here, but still important for sustainable farming systems, are farm worker and animal welfare, and cultural and socioeconomic aspects of food choices [@Jarmul2020].

Returning to the broader definition of sustainable diets, a diet must not only be environmentally sustainable but also promote an individual's health and well being, while being both accessible and culturally acceptable. To various degrees, health, accessibility and acceptability have all been part of the development of so-called food based dietary guidelines (FBDGs) that provide nutritional advice for how to eat to get adequate energy and nutrients to stay healthy. More than 100 countries either have or are developing a FBDG for their population [@Herforth2019; @FoodandAgricultureOrganizationoftheUnitedNationsa]. 

## Dietary guidelines

Even though there are differences between countries and regions, FBDGs around the world share similarities such as qualitative recommendations to eat high quality whole foods within one's energy requirements, include a variety of colorful vegetables (starchy roots and tubers are generally not counted as a vegetable in these instances) and fruit and other fiber rich foods such as whole grain cereals, legumes and nuts, consume fish and dairy foods, and have a low intake of processed foods, saturated fat, added sugar and salt [@Herforth2019]. This is also true of other healthy dietary patterns, such as the Mediterranean diet [@Davis2015a] or the New Nordic diet [@Mithril2012]. To make it easier to know how much to consume to eat a healthy diet, recommendations can also be quantitative by defining the number of portions and/or portion sizes. A well known example is to eat five portions of fruits and vegetables a day. In high income countries, it is also common to include a maximum red meat intake, like \<500 grams/week [@Herforth2019]. A few countries advise that home cooking and cooking skills are beneficial for healthy dietary habits [@BrazilDietaryGuidelines2015; @TheJapanDieteticAssociation; @HealthCanada2019].

FBDGs are often presented to consumers with images that show various food groups and their proportion in relation to each other in a healthy diet. An example is the Norwegian "diet circle" that can be seen in **Figure** \@ref(fig:kostholdssirkelen).

(ref:kostholdssirkelen-caption) The Norwegian diet circle, an illustration of how various food groups should contribute to a healthy Norwegian diet [@Helsedirektoratetb].

```{r kostholdssirkelen, out.width = "70%", fig.cap = "(ref:kostholdssirkelen-caption)"}
knitr::include_graphics("images/kostsirkelen.PNG")
```

The largest food groups in such visualizations are starchy staples like grains and grain-based products, starchy roots and tubers, fruit and vegetables and legumes [@Herforth2019]. These food groups provide, among a multitude of beneficial micronutrients and other compounds, carbohydrates to the diet in the form of starch, sugar and fiber. The importance of these foods is also reflected in different guidelines recommendations for macronutrient intake, where recommended percentage of energy intake (E%) from carbohydrate is relatively high compared to the other energy-providing macronutrients protein and fat [@Buyken2018].

Recently FBDGs have started to address environmental sustainability. FBDGs from Brazil [@BrazilDietaryGuidelines2015], Canada [@HealthCanada2019], Denmark [@Foedevarestyrelsen], France [@FoodandAgricultureOrganizationoftheUnitedNations], Germany [@Schafer2021], Netherlands [@Brink2019], Sweden [@SwedishFood], and Qatar [@Seed2015] include advice on how to eat not only for individual health, but also in an environmentally sustainable manner. Environmental impact will also be included in the new Nordic Nutrition Recommendations (NNR) for 2022, that will be used as a basis for FBDGs in the Nordic and Baltic countries [@Helsedirektoratetc]. It is likely that even more countries are working on this.

Following a predominantly plant-based diet rich in whole grains, legumes, nuts, fruit and vegetables with low to moderate consumption of animal sourced foods is an advice commonly given to consumers that want to be environmentally friendly, while still eating healthy [@Willett2019; @SwedishFood; @Foedevarestyrelsen; @Brink2019; @Seed2015]. In the case of water footprint, total water footprint might decrease by reducing the intake of animal sourced foods, but this could come at the cost of a higher blue water footprint [@Harris2020], putting strain on water scarce areas. This is especially true when animal sourced foods are reduced while intake of water intensive nuts, fruits or cereals are increased, made worse by the fact that these foods may be grown in areas with water scarcity [@Vanham2020; @Harris2020].

Animal sourced foods are generally nutrient dense, and they are not required in large amounts in the diet to provide necessary nutrients for good health [@Willett2019]. If eliminating animal sourced foods completely, as when following a vegan diet, special focus must be placed on vitamin B12, vitamin B2, vitamin D, iodine, zinc, calcium and selenium as these nutrients are either not present in plant-based foods (vitamin B12) or more difficult to obtain [@Bakaloudi2021]. Other advice presented in FBDGs that include environmental impact is to eat local, seasonal produce and choose organic if possible, and to reduce intake of discretionary and nutrient poor foods such as confectionery.

By following national FBDGs, an individual should meet their recommended dietary intake (RDI) of all nutrients, and thus support their good health and well-being. Unfortunately, many studies have found that adherence to FBDGs is low, especially when it comes to intake of healthy and relatively sustainable foods such as fruit and vegetables, legumes, whole grain cereals, nuts and seeds, fish and dairy, and for unhealthy foods high in sugar, salt and/or saturated fat [@Valen2020; @Derbyshire2018; @Leme2021; @Brettschneider2021; @Kristjansdottir2009; @Bel2019; @AlThani2018; @VerlyJunior2013; @HopeAbel2021]. This pattern is seen in all age groups, genders and socioeconomic groups, but lower adherence to FBDGs is more prevalent in lower socioeconomic groups. Low adherence is associated with increased risk of malnutrition and associated diseases. In 2013 FAO estimated that the costs of malnutrition in the world could be as high as US \$3.5 trillion [@AgricultureandEconomicDevelopmentAnalysisDivision2013].

There is wide consensus that a higher adherence to healthy dietary habits such as following national FBDGs would lower disease burden of individuals globally and substantially decrease health costs [@Schulze2018; @mcculloughDietPatternsMortality2014; @USDA2014]. The Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation has in their Global Burden of Disease series quantified how low adherence to different advice found in FBDGs contribute to mortality and disease risk in 195 countries [@Afshin2019]. Both globally and in most of the included countries, the leading causes of diet related mortality and disability adjusted life years were high salt intake and low intake of whole grain cereals, fruit, nuts and seeds and vegetables. Additionally, on a global level the consumption of meat  is higher than what is needed for good health [@Leme2021]. However, while many high-income countries would benefit from a lower intake of meat, in other parts of the world an increase in meat intake could be beneficial due to poor nutritional status in the population [@Willett2019; @Adesogan2020]. It is clear that by improving adherence to dietary guidelines the environmental impact of our diets would decrease, as it would mean an increased intake of foods with a low environmental impact at the expense of high environmental impact foods [@Kovacs2021; @Steenson2021].

To make good dietary choices, the population must have nutritional literacy: "the ability to critically analyze nutrition information, increase awareness and participate in action to address barriers to healthy eating behaviors." [@Guttersrud2014; @SpiteriCornish2015]. Low nutritional literacy, which typically includes difficulty finding and interpreting reliable nutrition information, has been associated with low adherence to healthy dietary habits [@Taylor2019; @Kalkan2019; @Hill2020; @Liao2019]. Concerns have been raised that contradictory messaging on diet and health, for example in news media, cause confusion and lower intentions to follow healthy dietary advice [@Lee2018a; @Clark2019; @Nagler2014; @Vijaykumar2021]. These concerns could also apply to making food choices with low environmental impact, especially as consumers tend to associate healthiness with environmental sustainability [@VanLoo2017; @Grunert2020; @Barone2019; @Verain2016].

It is beyond the scope of this thesis to include a comprehensive review of the literature on the systemic and individual factors that underlie food choice that in turn influence the healthiness and sustainability of ones diet, but for a more thorough discussion of the science, read the review by Chen and Antonelli [@Chen2020]. In short, the availability, accessibility and affordability of healthy foods in the environment, together with individual food preferences, cultural norms and knowledge of the relationship between diet and health all play a role.

An interesting environmental factor that could influence which foods are consumed is recipes [@Doub2016]. Analysis of food and nutrient content in recipes have been suggested as a way to follow food trends and dietary patterns in a population [@Buisman2019; @Eidner2013], and to monitor the relationship between food consumption and health [@Trattner2017b]. This could also be true for the other domains of sustainable diets. Using recipes could be a less resource intensive method to gather dietary information than typically used food-frequency questionnaires, dietary interviews or food diaries.

## Recipes in nutritional research

Cooking dinners at home has been associated with improved dietary quality and higher adherence to healthy dietary patterns like FBDGs [@Tiwari2017; @Mills2017; @Wolfson2020], although clinical relevance is uncertain. Still, in a recent European survey with more than 27 000 respondents, more than 40% of European consumers believe cooking at home is part of a sustainable diet [@Grunert2020]. Meal planning, of which recipes can be an integral part, is also a tool consumers can use to reduce their food waste, and by that reduce the environmental impact and cost of their diets making it more sustainable [@Principato2021]. 

While cooking at home and meal planning can be part of sustainable diet habits, this will depend on the type of meals that are prepared. Consumers find inspiration for what meals to cook in various sources, such as cookbooks and on the Internet [@Doub2016]. Recipes from cookbooks, internet recipe sites, blogs and retailer magazines have garnered attention as they have a large reach, and could potentially influence the food choices of many.

Several studies have looked at how well recipes found in cookbooks [@Irwin2017; @Howard2012; @Jones2013], supermarket magazines [@Wademan2020], food blogs [@Schneider2013; @Keogh2019; @Dickinson2018] or other Internet recipe sites [@Trattner2017a; @Jones2013; @Cheng2021] compare to dietary guidelines and/or other classification schemes for healthy meals such as various front-of-pack nutrition labeling systems. A limitation of these studies is the lack of micronutrient content analysis besides sodium, and little mention of the food based dietary advice found in FBDGs such as intake of whole grains or lean fish. Still, results are sobering as most recipes studied do not comply with healthy dietary principles as defined in the studies. Less is known about how recipes align with the other domains of sustainable diets.

## Thesis aims

This thesis aim to explore a selection of recipes from the United Kingdom (UK), Norway and the United States of America (US), from cookbooks (UK) and the Internet (Norway, US), and compare two domains of sustainable diets, namely health and environmental sustainability. To build on previous studies on recipe's healthiness, a comprehensive analysis of recipe's nutrient content and inclusion of foods encouraged in FBDGs will be included.

The following research questions are asked:

1: To what extent do recipes from Norway, the UK and the US comply with healthy dietary guideline principles, and to what extent does environmental sustainability relate to healthiness?

2: To what extent does a recipe’s healthiness and environmental sustainability depend on country of origin?
