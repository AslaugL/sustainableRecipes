# Background

Not only are unhealthy diets that lead to malnutrition believed to be
responsible for one in five adult deaths and 15% of the total adult
disability adjusted life years (DALYs) globally [@Afshin2019], but our
current food system, i.e. how we produce, distribute and process food
items, is also taking its toll on the environment. Globally, food
production accounts for 70% of fresh water resources [@Shukla2019](p5),
42-61% of land resources [@Shukla2019](p6) and 21-37% of total
greenhouse gas emissions (GHGE) [@Crippa2021]. Additionally there is
growing awareness of how food production can negatively impact
biodiversity, increase soil degradation and pollute air, water and land
[@Benton2021; @RodriguezEugenio2018; @Domingo2021; @Kopittke2019]. This
is made even worse by the fact that about a third of all food produced
in the world is either lost or wasted through the supply-chain or at the
consumer. Food waste the third largest contributor to the world's GHGEs
[@FoodandAgricultureOrganizationoftheUnitedNations2013], and accounts
for 23-24% of freshwater, land and fertilizer used in food production
[@Kummu2012]. The EAT-Lancet Commission on Food, Planet, Health states
that food production is the largest cause of global environmental change
[@Willett2019]. With a growing human population, if current trends in
production and consumption patterns continue, more people will end up
malnourished and the stress on the environment will increase.

This is the background for the need to develop diets that are both
healthy and environmentally sustainable, so called "Sustainable Healthy
Diets". The World Health Organization (WHO) and the Food and Agriculture
Organization of the United Nations (FAO) defines a sustainable healthy
diet as a diet that: "promote all dimensions of individuals' health and
well being; have low environmental pressure and impact; are accessible,
affordable, safe and equitable; and are culturally acceptable."
[@FoodandAgricultureOrganizationoftheUnitedNations2019]

An interesting source of data on food sustainability are recipes. As a
common source of information and inspiration, recipes can be used to
study how various foods are combined by consumers. This can provide
insight into food combinations that are in alignment with sustainable
healthy diet principles, and the relationship between the various
aspects of sustainability included in this concept.

## The environmental impact of food

An environmentally sustainable food system is defined as a system which
effect "on the surrounding natural environment are neutral or positive,
taking into consideration biodiversity, water, soil, animal and plant
health, the carbon footprint, the water footprint, food loss and waste,
and toxicity."

Most research that has been done on the environmental impact of
different foods have focused on GHGE. Increased GHGE cause climate
change, which with various degrees of certainty will result in sea level
rise, ocean acidification, increased temperature and more extreme
weather events such as floods and droughts [@Masson-Delmotte2021]. This
in turn can have consequences on the yield and nutrition value of crops
and livestock products, and worsen nutrition status of humans
[@Hatfield2011; @Rojas-Downing2017]. Sustainability is now an important
consideration for food security, the physical and economical access
individuals have to nutritious and safe foods [@Shukla2019 ;
@Gustafson2016].

The environmental impact of foods are commonly found through life cycle
assessments (LCAs), a "compilation and evaluation of the inputs,
outputs, and potential environmental impacts of a product system
throughout its life cycle." [@Cucurachi2019] The input in an LCA for a
food product could be the raw materials used to produce farm equipment,
the energy source used for heating a greenhouse or powering a tractor,
the resources used to make fertilizer or feed, and how the food is
packaged, distributed, processed and finally how any waste produced is
handled. The result is the environmental impact (GHGE, land use, water
footprint, eutrophication, acidification and/or others) per output
functional unit of the food. The functional unit varies, but could be
the kilo of food produced at the farm, or that reaches the consumer.
Other functional units used are amounts of energy, protein and various
micronutrients produced, or hectares of land used to produce a given
amount of product. There are no standardized method to perform an LCA of
a food, so it can be difficult to compare results between studies that
have performed LCAs with various inputs, outputs and type of
environmental impact.

In general, production at the farm contributes the most to a food's
environmental impact, while distribution, packaging, processing,
preparation and waste removal is less important [@Crippa2021;
@Ledgard2010; @EulalioNeto2021].

There are however huge variations both within and between the same foods
and food groups (see **Figure** \@ref(fig:environmental-impacts)). A
food could also be sustainable when looking at one type of environmental
impact, but harmful when looking at another. Details such as
geographical location and available local resources, seasonality, herd
size and production capacity for animals, outdoor or indoor production
system, energy sources used for production, type of fertilizer and/or
pest control used for crops and type of feed used for animals (crops
that are edible for humans or not) can all influence the environmental
impact of a given food.

```{r environmental-impacts, fig.cap = "Greenhouse gas emissions, land and water footprint of various food groups."}
knitr::include_graphics("images/environmental_impacts.jpg")
```

### Difference between food groups

Multiple studies have found that industrial meat production from
ruminants is the largest contributor to GHGE and land use in the
agriculture sector [@Clune2017; @Phelps2017; @Mertens2019]. Per kilo
produced, median GHGE from beef is 71 times higher than in season field
grown vegetables, 53 times higher than cereals and legumes, 22 times
higher than tree nuts, eight times higher than fish, seven times higher
than chicken, five times higher than pork, three times higher than
shrimps and prawns, and about similar to lamb [@Clune2017].

The situation is more nuanced when it comes to the water footprint.
There are three types of water that must be taken into account, namely
blue water (surface- and groundwater), green water (rainwater) and gray
water (surface- and groundwater that has been polluted)
[@Gerbens-Leenes2013]. Around the world, scarcity of blue and green
water varies [@Rosa2020; @Schyns2019], and it depends on the region if
production of food overtaxes water availability. While the global
average total water footprint of beef per kilo produced is higher than
for other animals (2.6 times more than pork, 3.6 times more than chicken
[@Mekonnen2012]), if green water is excluded the water footprint of beef
is similar to that of pork and chicken [@Gerbens-Leenes2013]. The global
average total water footprint per kilo produced of beef is 21.8 times
higher than vegetables, 9.4 times higher than cereals, 3.8 times higher
than pulses and 1.7 times higher than nuts. When removing green water,
beef has 5.4 times the water footprint of vegetables, 2.4 times the
water footprint of cereals, about the same water footprint as pulses,
and half the water footprint of nuts [@Mekonnen2011; @Mekonnen2012].
There is a lack of water footprint analyses of seafood, but aquaculture
in China has been found to have a similar blue and green water footprint
to global levels for chicken [@Gephart2017].

Of land used for agriculture, about 75% is used for pastures, while the
remaining 25% is used for croplands [@Shukla2019] (p6). The median area
of land used to produce one kilo of fat and bone free meat of beef is
568 times higher than a kg of assorted vegetables, 30.4 that of farmed
fish, 19.6 times more than nuts, 15.5 times that of poultry, 14 times
that of pulses, 12.7 that of pork and 1.3 times that of lamb
[@Poore2018a].

Turning natural land into croplands or pasture is the principal cause of
habitat loss of wild species, which in turn is associated with loss of
biodiversity [@Benton2021]. The expanding use of natural lands may lead
to an increased exposure to infectious pathogens from animals, in worst
case leading to future pandemics [@Wilkinson2018; @Patz2004; @Wolfe2007;
@Dobson2020]. Water used for farming also shunts water away from natural
ecosystems. Runoff, excess nutrients from fertilizer, can end up in
rivers and other water systems leading to eutrophication, the overgrowth
of algae at the expense of other species. Pesticide use is also
associated with loss of biodiversity [@Benton2021]. Organic farming
practices have been shown to be less damaging to biodiversity than
conventional farming, but produce lower yields so that per functional
unit produced GHGE, water footprint and land use is higher
[@Reganold2016]. However, concerns have been raised that typical LCAs
fail to adequately assess the full environmental impact of organic
farming, and that results may be to overestimate acidification,
eutrophication and global warming potential while downplaying the
benefits [@Meier2015].

Included in LCAs of animal production, included farmed fish, is the
environmental impact of growing feed. Currently a third of all crops
grown are used to feed animals. While ruminants can be fed roughage that
are not edible for humans, non-ruminants (pork, chicken and farmed fish)
feed consists of cereals that could feed humans [@Makkar2018;
@Pahlow2015]. The rise of fish farming means that more crops will be
grown for fish feed in the future, likely leading to an increase of
farmed fish's water and land footprint [@Pahlow2015]. However, the
increased use of crops in fish feed has come about in part due to
overfishing of marine ingredients used in the feed, and the use of crops
reduce the strain on these marine resources.

Additional concerns not mentioned here, but still important for
sustainable farming systems, are farm worker and animal welfare, and
cultural and socioeconomic aspects of food choices [@Jarmul2020].

While many countries and regions have long since developed
regional/national food based dietary guidelines (FBDGs) that provide
nutritional advice for how to eat to get adequate energy and nutrients
to stay healthy [@Herforth2019], it is only recently that FBDGs have
been developed that also take environmental impact into account.

## Dietary guidelines

There are more than 100 countries in the world that either have or are
developing a FBDG [@FoodandAgricultureOrganizationoftheUnitedNationsa].
These guidelines are developed by reviewing relevant studies on diet and
health, and translating it into guidelines for healthy eating that fits
the national context. Among other things this means taking into account
which foods are available and culturally acceptable in that
country/region, that can be eaten to supply the body with the nutrients
it needs and not cause ill health. In the latest FBDG update from Brazil
[@BrazilDietaryGuidelines2015], Denmark [@Fødevarestyrelsen], France
[@FoodandAgricultureOrganizationoftheUnitedNations], Germany
[@Schafer2021], Netherlands [@Brink2019], Sweden [@SwedishFood], and
Qatar [@Seed2015] individuals are not only advised on how to eat a
healthy diet, but also an environmentally sustainable one. Environmental
impact will also be included in the new Nordic Nutritional
Recommendations (NNR) for 2022, that will be used as a basis for FBDGs
in the Nordic and Baltic countries [@Helsedirektoratetc]. It is likely
that even more countries are working on this.

Even though there are differences between countries and regions, FBDGs
around the world share similarities such as recommendations to eat high
quality whole foods within one's energy requirements, include a variety
of colorful vegetables (starchy roots and tubers are generally not
counted as a vegetable in these instances) and fruit and other fiber
rich foods such as whole grain cereals, legumes and nuts, consume fish
and dairy foods, and have a low intake of processed foods, saturated
fat, added sugar and salt [@Herforth2019]. In high income countries, it
is also common to include a maximum red meat intake, like \<500
grams/week.

FBDGs are often presented to consumers with images that show various
food groups and their proportion in relation to each other in a healthy
diet. An example is the Norwegian "diet circle" that can be seen in
**Figure** \@ref(fig:kostholdssirkelen).

```{r kostholdssirkelen, fig.cap = "The Norwegian diet circle, an illustration of how various food groups should contribute to a healthy Norwegian diet[@Helsedirektoratetb]."}
knitr::include_graphics("images/kostsirkelen.PNG")
```

The largest food groups in such visualizations are starchy staples like
grains and grain-based products, starchy roots and tubers, fruit and
vegetables and legumes [@Herforth2019]. These food groups provide, among
a multitude of beneficial micronutrients and other compounds,
carbohydrates to the diet in the form of starch, sugar and fiber. The
importance of these foods is also reflected in different guidelines
recommendations for macronutrient intake, where recommended energy
intake (E%) from carbohydrate is relatively high compared to the other
energy-providing macronutrients protein and fat [@Buyken2018].

Following a predominantly plant-based diet rich in whole grains,
legumes, nuts, fruit and vegetables with low to moderate consumption of
animal sourced foods is an advice commonly given to consumers that want
to be environmentally friendly, while still eating healthy
[@Willett2019; @SwedishFood; @Fødevarestyrelsen; @Brink2019; @Seed2015].
Although in the case of nuts concerns are raised due to the high water
footprint of nuts, made worse by the fact that most nuts are grown in
areas with water scarcity [@Vanham2020]. Animal sourced foods are
generally nutrient dense, and they are not required in large amounts in
the diet to provide necessary nutrients for good health [@Willett2019].
If eliminating animal sourced foods completely, as when following a
vegan diet, special focus must be placed on vitamin B12, vitamin B2,
vitamin D, iodine, zinc, calcium and selenium as these nutrients are
either not present in plant-based foods (vitamin B12) or more difficult
to obtain [@Bakaloudi2021]. Other advice presented in FBDGs that include
environmental impact is to eat local, seasonal produce and choose
organic if possible, and to reduce intake of nutrient poor foods such as
confectionery.

By following national FBDGs, an individual should meet their recommended
dietary intake (RDI) of all nutrients, and thus support their good
health and well-being. However, many studies have found that adherence
to FBDGs is low, especially when it comes to intake of healthy and
relatively sustainable foods such as fruit and vegetables, legumes,
whole grain cereals, nuts and seeds, fish and dairy, and for unhealthy
foods high in sugar, salt and/or saturated fat [@Valen2020;
@Derbyshire2018; @Leme2021; @Brettschneider2021; @Kristjansdottir2009;
@Bel2019; @AlThani2018; @VerlyJunior2013; @HopeAbel2021]. This pattern
is seen in all age groups, genders and socioeconomic groups, but lower
adherence to FBDGs is more prevalent in lower socioeconomic groups. Low
adherence is associated with increased risk of malnutrition and
associated diseases. In 2013 FAO estimated that the costs of
malnutrition in the world could be as high as US \$3.5 trillion
[@AgricultureandEconomicDevelopmentAnalysisDivision2013].

There is wide consensus that a higher adherence to healthy dietary
habits such as following national FBDGs would lower disease burden of
individuals globally and substantially decrease health costs
[@Schulze2018; @McCullough2014; @USDA2014]. The Institute for Health
Metrics and Evaluation has in their Global Burden of Disease series
quantified how low adherence to different advice found in FBDGs
contribute to mortality and disease risk in 195 countries [@Afshin2019].
Both globally and in most of the included countries, the leading causes
of diet related mortality and DALYs were high salt intake and low intake
of whole grain cereals, fruit, nuts and seeds and vegetables.
Additionally, on a global level the consumption of meat is higher than
what is needed for good health [@Leme2021], but while many high-income
countries would benefit from a lower intake, in other parts of the world
an increase in meat intake could be beneficial due to poor nutritional
status in the population [@Willett2019].

There are several sources of dietary information available to the
general consumer. Concerns have been raised that contradictory messaging
on diet and health, for example in news media, cause confusion and lower
intentions to follow healthy dietary advice [@Lee2018a; @Clark2019;
@Nagler2014; @Vijaykumar2021]. To make good dietary choices, the
population must have nutritional literacy: "the ability to critically
analyze nutrition information, increase awareness and participate in
action to address barriers to healthy eating behaviors."
[@Guttersrud2014; @SpiteriCornish2015]. Low nutritional literacy, which
typically includes difficulty finding and interpreting reliable
nutrition information, has been associated with low adherence to healthy
dietary habits [@Taylor2019; @Kalkan2019; @Hill2020; @Liao2019]. These
concerns could also apply to making food choices with low environmental
impact, especially as consumers tend to associate healthiness with
environmental sustainability [@VanLoo2017; @Grunert2020; @Barone2019;
@Verain2016].

A 2020 survey of over 27000 consumers in 27 EU member states found that
66% participants claim to "always" or "most of the time" eat a healthy
and sustainable diet [@Grunert2020]. This is in stark contrast with
findings on both the healthiness and environmental sustainability of our
diets previously mentioned.

The European consumers in the survey associate sustainable diets first
and foremost with healthy foods, but also with low use of pesticides,
affordability, short supply chains and to a lesser extent low
environmental impact. To eat a sustainable diet, consumers answered they
should increase their intake of fruit and vegetables (58%), eat foods
that are local and in season (47%), cook at home (43%), choose foods
with low amounts of pesticides (43%) and avoid wasting food (42%). Only
a third of participants answered that eating a sustainable diet would
involve a reduced intake of meat, or an increased intake of high-fibre
foods such as whole grain cereals, and only one quarter answered that a
sustainable diet involved eating foods with a low CO~2~ (a greenhouse
gas) footprint [@Grunert2020].

Norwegian consumers believe that reducing food waste and eating more
locally produced food is most beneficial to the environment, while
eating organic or reducing meat intake was seen as the least beneficial
contribution they could make [@Austgulen2018]. This is similar to UK
consumers, who consider reduced consumption of air freighted foods,
reduced food waste and increased local produce to have a high
environmental benefit (believed by \>75%), while only 42% and 27%
believe that is the case for plant-based protein and organic produce
respectively [@Culliford2020]. Spaniards associate food sustainability
with environmental impacts, biodiversity, local foods and GHGE. The
majority of Spanish consumers have a negative view of the sustainability
of processed foods (\~85), while the opposite is true for fruit and
vegetables. Meat is seen as positive for sustainability by about 50%
[@Garcia-Gonzalez2020].

Brazilian consumers share many beliefs with Europeans when it comes to
food sustainability. Sustainable diets in Brazil are associated with
healthiness, plant-based and organic foods, environmental preservation
and little food waste [@Barone2019]. There is a lack of studies on
consumer perception and beliefs when it comes to sustainable diets in
low-middle income countries, and countries outside of Europe. It is also
difficult to compare studies and surveys on the topic as different
themes and questions are explored.

While consumers might know that eating more plants are beneficial for
the environment, many studies have shown that few consumers are aware of
the environmental impact of meat, and to the extent a plant-based diet
can reduce environmental impact [@Sanchez-Sabate2019]. Studies also show
that environmental impact often ranks below other concerns such as
taste, price, healthiness and animal welfare when consumers decide which
food to buy [@Grunert2014; @Grunert2020; @Mann2018; @Clonan2015]. Still,
in the health survey of the Norwegian population performed in 2020, 62%
stated they had changed their diets to a lesser or greater degree in the
last three years to improve its environmental impact [@HopeAbel2021].

It is beyond the scope of this thesis to include a comprehensive review
of the literature on the systemic and individual factors that underlie
food choice that in turn influence the healthiness and sustainability of
ones diet, but for a more thorough discussion of the science, please
read the review by Chen and Antonelli [@Chen2020]. In short, the
availability, accessibility and affordability of healthy foods in the
environment, together with individual food preferences, cultural norms
and knowledge of the relationship between diet and health all play a
role.

## Recipes as a source of food information

To avoid what is known as "nutrition confusion",

-   Could potentially avoid self-censoring and other biases of food
    diaries and 24 hour recalls

To help consumers make informed, healthy dietary choices when shopping
for foods, WHO recommends the use of front-of-pack (FOP) nutrition
labels, that provide consumers with easy to understand nutrition
information at a glance [@WorldHealthOrganization2014;
@WorldHealthOrganization2013; @WorldHealthOrganizaton2016]. There also
exists some FOP labels to help consumers make sustainable food choices
[@Liu2016; @Cornish2020; @Meyerding2019; @Grunert2014].

### 

## Front of pack labels

### Nutrition labels

In 2019 there were over 30 countries around the world that have endorsed
the use of FOP nutrition labels as a tool to make it easier for
consumers to choose healthier food options [@Jones2019]. In most
countries the use of these labels by food manufacturers and retail is
voluntary, but a few countries including Chile, South Korea, Mexico and
Finland have mandatory FOP nutrition labels [@Jones2019]. There are two
groups of FOPs, summary labels and nutrient-specific labels
[@Temple2020]. In both groups, qualifying (i.e. healthy) and
disqualifying (i.e. unhealthy) components are used to decide on a food's
healthiness. Summary labels use a set of criteria that can be turned
into an algorithm to decide a food's healthiness, while
nutrient-specific labels showcase the amount of the various
qualifying/disqualifying components in the food per 100 g/per serving.
Typically the nutrients fat, saturated fat, sodium (or salt) and added
sugar are seen as disqualifying components, while protein, fibre and
omega-3 fatty acids are seen as qualifying. The addition of fruits,
vegetables, nuts, legumes and healthy fats such as olive and nut oils is
also qualifying in some criteria. Some FOPs uses a mix of disqualifying
and qualifying components to decide if a food is healthy or not, while
others use only one or the other [@VanderBend2019; @Temple2020].

There is also a difference in what message is conveyed. The Scandinavian
Keyhole is a single mark summary label that is given to foods that are a
healthier option in their given product category, such as ready-made
meals or breads. For the Keyhole there are different thresholds of
disqualifying (energy, fat, saturated fat, trans fat, sodium and sugar)
and qualifying components (energy, fibre, fruits, vegetables, nuts,
legumes) per 100 g for what it takes to receive the label depending on
product category, and some product categories such as soft drinks cannot
receive the label at all [@VanderBend2019, @Helsedirektoratet2015]. The
Multiple Traffic Light System used in the UK is a nutrient-specific
label that only include disqualifying components (fat, saturated fat,
sodium and added sugar), and the same threshold values for the various
components is used on all food categories. The Multiple Traffic Light
System presents the consumer with the values of each disqualifying
component per 100 g/per serving in grams and percentage of the daily
amount one should eat, color coded with either green for "low", amber
for "medium", or red for "high" [@VanderBend2019]. Consumers are advised
to choose foods with more green and amber than red
[@BritishNutritionFoundation2019]. Yet another type of FOP is the
Nutriscore, that originated in France and is now used in many countries
in Europe. Like the Keyhole label, the Nutriscore is a summary label
that uses both disqualifying (energy, saturated fat, sodium, added
sugar) and qualifying components (protein, fibre, fruits, vegetables,
nuts, legumes, olive oil, nut oil, rapeseed oil) per 100 g/100 ml of a
food/drink. However, where the Keyhole is a single mark given to foods
that comply the given set of criteria, the Nutriscore is a gradient from
A (dark green, healthy) to E (dark orange, less healthy), where the
value of the specific food is highlighted [@VanderBend2019;
@Chantal2017; @SantePubliqueFrance2021; @SantePubliqueFrance2021a].
Originally the Nutriscore was used as-is on all food product categories,
but it was changed to have specific criteria for fats and dairy. The
design of the mentioned FOPs can be seen in **Figure**
\@ref(fig:nutritionlabels).

```{r nutritionlabels, fig.cap = "Examples of front of pack nutrition labels used in Europe, the Multiple Traffic Light System (UK), Nutriscore (France, Belgium, Spain, Portugal, Germany, the Netherlands, Switzerland and Luxembourg) and Keyhole (Scandinavia)."}
knitr::include_graphics("images/nutritionlabels.PNG")
```

These labels provide simplified dietary information and are accessible
to the consumer when making dietary choices while food shopping. Another
potential consequence of the mandatory use of FOP nutrition labels, is
that manufacturers improve the healthiness of their products to be able
to receive a FOP label. Indeed, a recent meta analysis found that the
use of FOP nutrition labels influence consumers to reduce their intake
of energy and fat, and increase their intake of vegetables. At the same
time, it was found that food manufacturers reduced the amount of
sodium/salt in their product formulas [@Shangguan2019]. The European
Academy of Paediatrics and the European Childhood Obesity Group have
called for a uniform, mandatory FOP nutrition label use in the European
Union to help mitigate the rising obesity trend in European children and
adolescents [@Deren2021].

There are of course other interventions and tools that governments,
together with the industry and non-profit organizations use to improve
dietary choices of general consumers, such as promotional campaigns and
regulatory restrictions and mandates, but such interventions would be
outside the scope of this thesis. For a review please read Russo et al
[@Russo2020].

### Sustainability labels

Sustainability labels are not as much used as nutrition labels, but
labeling schemes exist for foods that are organic, local, come from
sustainable fisheries, have high animal welfare or worker's rights,
and/or a low carbon footprint [@Liu2016; @Cornish2020;
@MarineStewardshipCouncil; @Meyerding2019]. Recently, retailers in
France have developed the Ecoscore, a sustainability label for their
geographical region in line with the summary Nutriscore, that has both
qualifying (environmental benefits such as organic or local production)
and disqualifying (packaged in non--recyclable packaging, has
ingredients with negative environmental impacts such as lowered
biodiversity) properties [@ecoscore-criteria]. In the UK, Foundation
Earth has developed a sustainability label after the model of
nutrient-specific labels [@foundation-earth].

There is uncertainty if sustainability labels improve the sustainability
of consumer's food choices [@Liu2016; @DeBauw2021; @Grunert2014].

## Meals, not guidelines or labels

While dietary guidelines and FOP labels can help individuals make
healthy, and perhaps sustainable, food choices, foods are seldom bought
to be eaten in isolation. Rather, they are bought to be part of meals.
Consumers find inspiration for what meals to cook in various sources,
such as cookbooks and on the Internet [@Doub2016].

Several studies have looked at how well recipes found in cookbooks
[@Irwin2017; @Howard2012], supermarket magazines [@Wademan2020], food
blogs [@Schneider2013; @Keogh2019; @Dickinson2018] or other Internet
sources such as recipe sites [@Trattner2017a] compare to dietary
guidelines and/or FOP labeling schemes. Results are sobering, as most
recipes studied do not comply with healthy dietary principles. To date,
I am not aware of any study on these kinds of recipes sustainability.

## Thesis aims

This thesis aims to look at a selection of recipes from three countries
(UK, Norway, US), from cookbooks (UK) and the Internet (Norway, US), and
compare their health and sustainability.

RQ1: How sustainable are recipes from these countries?

RQ2: Do sustainability indicators correlate with healthiness indicators?

RQ3: Do sustainability indicators correlate with micronutrient content?
