# Background

## Diet, health and sustainability

Not only are unhealthy diets that lead to malnutrition believed to be
responsible for one in five adult deaths and 15% of the total adult
disability adjusted life years (DALYs) globally [@Afshin2019], but our
current food system, i.e. how we produce, distribute and process food
items, is also taking its toll on the environment. The EAT-Lancet
Commission on Food, Planet, Health states that food production is the
largest cause of global environmental change [@Willett2019].

This is the background for the need to develop diets that are both
healthy and environmentally sustainable, so called "Sustainable Healthy
Diets". The World Health Organization (WHO) and the Food and Agriculture
Organization of the United Nations (FAO) defines a sustainable healthy
diet as a diet that: "promote all dimensions of individuals' health and
well being; have low environmental pressure and impact; are accessible,
affordable, safe and equitable; and are culturally acceptable."
[@FoodandAgricultureOrganizationoftheUnitedNations2019]

While these four aspects of sustainable diets are all important, this
thesis will focus on two of them: Healthiness and environmental impact.

### Consequences of malnutrition

There are three forms of malnutrition that are typically associated with
ill health. Undernutrition (low
weight-for-age/weight-for-height/height-for-age), micronutrient
deficiency or excess, and overnutrition (overweight/obesity)
[@WorldHealthOrganization]. WHO includes diet-related non-communicable
diseases (NCDs) such as cardiovascular disease, type II diabetes,
chronic pulmonary disease and certain types of cancer with
overnutrition. Not only can an unhealthy diet increase the risk of
developing these NCDs, it can also worsen the prognoses of those who
have already developed them [@Afshin2019; @Wu2016; @Casas2018;
@Steck2020].

Malnutrition is a global health issue, and every country in the world is
affected by at least one form of malnutrition
[@DevelopmentInitiatives2020](p21). Within a population, household or
individual, multiple forms of malnutrition can coexist. When this
happens, it is called the double or triple burden of malnutrition. For
example within a population some can be underweight while others can be
obese and/or suffer from micronutrient deficiencies or diet-related
NCDs, and an individual can be obese due to excess energy intake while
also struggling with micronutrient deficiencies due to low nutrient
quality of the foods eaten. The cost of malnutrition globally is
enormous, and in 2013 FAO estimated that the costs could be as high as
US \$3.5 trillion
[@AgricultureandEconomicDevelopmentAnalysisDivision2013].

While malnutrition is a global health issue, it affects populations
differently. Undernutrition is more common in low-middle income
countries (LMICs) than high income countries (HICs), and in lower
socioeconomic groups compared to high socioeconomic groups. Premortality
and impaired physical and cognitive capacities due to undernutrition
lead to large burdens on the health and economy of individuals and
societies. It is estimated that by investing US \$1 in reducing
undernutrition, a return of US \$18 would be achieved in countries with
a high burden of undernutrition
[@GlobalPanelonAgricultureandFoodSystemsforNutrition2016] (p14).
Globally the prevalence of undernutrition has decreased, although when
looking at country/regional level there are large variations
[@DevelopmentInitiatives2020] (p51-53). However, while undernutrition
has become less common, in the same areas there is a rapid rise in
overweight/obesity, contributing to the double burden of malnutrition in
these populations [@Bixby2019].

Overnutrition like being overweight/obese is increasing all over the
world, and more rapidly in LMICs [@DevelopmentInitiatives2020 (p51-53);
@Abarca-Gomez2017]. Currently, the prevalence of overnutrition is higher
in HICs than LMICs [@Min2018]. In Europe, as many as one in two adults
may be overweight or obese [@Marques2018], leading to high disease
burden. In 2015 being overweight/obese contributed to 4.0 million deaths
and approximately 120 million DALYs globally
[@TheGBD2015ObesityCollaborators2017]. This is mostly due to diet
related NCDs such as cardiovascular disease, diabetes, certain cancers
and chronic kidney disease. While it is difficult to calculate the
direct and indirect economic costs of overnutrition, they are believed
to be substantial. For the 38 countries in the Organization for Economic
Co-operation and Development, it is estimated that the average negative
effect of overweight/obesity on gross domestic product is 3.3 %
[@OrganisationforEconomicCo-operationandDevelopment2019].

Both under- and overnutrition can coexist with micronutrient
deficiencies. Micronutrient deficiencies are more common in LMICs than
HICs [@Bailey2015], but even in HICs in Europe and Central Asia
micronutrient deficiencies lead to substantial disease burden and DALYs
of 268 per 100 000 population [@Bruins2018]. Regardless of income
status, children and women of childbearing age are at highest risk
[@Bailey2015; @Bruins2018]. Of special concern are the micronutrients
iron, iodine, zinc, calcium, vitamin D, vitamin A and folate (vitamin
B9), with some regional differences.

Iron deficiency anemia is one of the five leading causes for years lived
with disability globally [@Vos2017], causing symptoms such as cognitive
impairments and fatigue. It is estimated that globally 18.8% of children
under five years of age, 20.1% of pregnant women and 16.3% of
nonpregnant women suffer from Iron deficiency anemia [@Vos2017]. Iodine
deficiency disorders are a leading cause of preventable mental
retardation globally, it can also cause goiter, and increases the risk
of perinatal and infant death [@Zimmermann2008]. In 2004, zinc
deficiency was estimated to be the cause of 4.4% of deaths in children
under five years of age in Latin America, Africa and Asia, and also
accounted for substantial morbidity from diarrhea, malaria and lower
respiratory tract infections in the same age group and region
[@Walker2008]. It is believed zinc deficiency is so prevalent it could
be a public health concern in most LMICs [@Gupta2020].

Inadequate calcium intake is associated with poorer bone health, and low
bone mineral density [@NIH-Calcium]. It is important to keep in mind
that for calcium to be absorbed from the diet, the host must have
adequate levels of the fat soluble vitamin D, meaning vitamin D
deficiency can contribute to calcium deficiency [@NIH-Calcium;
@NIH-VitD]. Estimates of average dietary calcium intake have been found
to be low in South, East and Southeast Asia, and low-moderate in Africa
and South America. In Europe, and especially Northern Europe most
countries have adequate dietary intake [@Balk2017]. Vitamin D can be
synthesized in the skin by exposure to sunlight, while some amounts can
also be obtained from foods. Supplementation is necessary in areas with
little sun exposure, and for people with no/little sun exposure due to
other reasons such as clothing that hides skin, as it is difficult to
reach the recommended daily intake amounts by diet alone. Vitamin D
deficiency is a global public health issue [@Roth2018]. In Europe the
prevalence is estimated to be 40.4 % irrespective of age group, ethnic
mix, and latitude of study populations, with dark-skinned ethnic groups
having a higher prevalence than caucasians [@Cashman2016]. Lack of
vitamin D and/or calcium can cause rickets in children and osteomalacia
in adults. The resurgence of rickets in Western countries is highest in
ethnic groups with dark skin [@Uday2019]. While there is less data on
prevalence rates in countries from Asia and Africa, even conservative
estimates put prevalence above that of Western countries
[@Prentice2013].

Other functions of vitamin D include support of the immune system, cell
growth and metabolism, and vitamin D deficiency is associated with a
range of both acute and chronic health conditions. These include
periodontitis, several types of cancer, cardiovascular disease, type II
diabetes, metabolic syndrome, autoimmune disease, asthma and infections
[@Palacios2014; @Roth2018]. There is not established causal
relationships between vitamin D and many of the conditions associated
with vitamin D deficiency, but this is under study.

Vitamin A deficiency is not common in HICs, but globally it is a leading
cause of preventable childhood blindness [@Wiseman2017], and associated
with increased mortality and morbidity in children under five years of
age [@Imdad2017]. Inadequate folate intake during pregnancy can cause
neural tube defects in the developing fetus, but also growth
retardation, low birth weight and preterm delivery [@NIH-Folate;
@Bailey2015]. In many LMICs, folate deficiency could be present in \>20%
of females of reproductive age, but there is limited data on prevalence,
and methodological issues call for cautious interpretations of these
estimates [@Rogers2018].

Malnutrition in any form is especially devastating for children and the
developing fetus. Malnutrition, especially undernutrition, is a
contributing factor in about 45% of death in children under five years
of age [@WorldHealthOrganization], and malnutrition early in life is
associated with impaired cognitive and physical development in addition
to increased risk of developing many diseases, such as NCDs, in
adulthood [@Bailey2015; @Peter2014]. There are also concerns that these
effects can be passed on to the next generation [@Kaspar2020].

The consequences of malnutrition are dire, and need to be addressed. At
the same time it must be done in such a way to reduce the climate impact
of our current dysfunctional food system to mitigate the consequences of
human activity to the Earth. This aspect cannot be ignored, as there is
a bi-directional relationship between our food and the climate.

### The environmental impact of food

Globally, food production accounts for 70% of fresh water resources
[@Shukla2019](p5), 42-61% of land resources [@Shukla2019](p6) and 21-37%
of total greenhouse gas emissions (GHGE) [@Crippa2021]. Additionally
there is growing awareness of how food production can negatively impact
biodiversity, increase soil degradation and pollute air, water and land
[@Benton2021; @RodriguezEugenio2018; @Domingo2021; @Kopittke2019]. This
is made even worse by the fact that about a third of all food produced
in the world is either lost or wasted through the supply-chain or at the
consumer. Food waste the third largest contributor to the world's GHGE
[@FoodandAgricultureOrganizationoftheUnitedNations2013] , and accounts
for 23-24% of freshwater, land and fertilizer used in food production
[@Kummu2012].

An environmentally sustainable food system is defined as a system which
effect "on the surrounding natural environment are neutral or positive,
taking into consideration biodiversity, water, soil, animal and plant
health, the carbon footprint, the water footprint, food loss and waste,
and toxicity."

Most research that has been done on the environmental impact of
different foods have focused on GHGE. Increased GHGE cause climate
change, which with various degrees of certainty will result in sea level
rise, ocean acidification, increased temperature and more extreme
weather events such as floods and droughts [@Masson-Delmotte2021]. This
in turn can have consequences on the yield and nutrition value of
produce and livestock products, and worsen nutrition status of humans
[@Hatfield2011; @Rojas-Downing2017]. Sustainability is now an important
consideration for food security, the physical and economical access
individuals have to nutritious and safe foods [@Shukla2019 ;
@Gustafson2016].

The environmental impact of foods are commonly found through life cycle
assessments (LCAs), a "compilation and evaluation of the inputs,
outputs, and potential environmental impacts of a product system
throughout its life cycle." [@Cucurachi2019] The input in an LCA for a
food product could be the raw materials used to produce farm equipment,
the energy source used for heating a greenhouse or powering a tractor,
how the food is packaged, distributed, processed and finally how any
waste produced is handled. The result is the environmental impact (GHGE,
land use, water footprint, eutrophication, acidification and/or others)
per output functional unit of the food. The functional unit varies, but
could be the kilo of food produced at the farm, or that reaches the
consumer. Other functional units used are amounts of energy, protein and
various micronutrients produced, or hectares of land used to produce a
given amount of product. There are no standardized method to perform an
LCA of a food, so it can be difficult to compare results between studies
that have performed LCAs with various inputs, outputs and type of
environmental impact.

#### Different foods, different impact

In general, production at the farm contributes the most to a food's
environmental impact, while distribution, packaging, processing,
preparation and waste removal is less important [@Crippa2021;
@Ledgard2010; @EulalioNeto2021].

There are however huge variations both within and between the same foods
and food groups. A food could also be sustainable when looking at one
type of environmental impact, but very harmful when looking at another.

Multiple studies have found that industrial meat production from
ruminants is the largest contributor to GHGE and land use in the
agriculture sector [@Clune2017; @Phelps2017; @Mertens2019]. Per kilo
produced, median GHGE from beef is 71 times higher than field grown
vegetables, 53 times higher than cereals and legumes, 22 times higher
than tree nuts, eight times higher than fish, seven times higher than
chicken, five times higher than pork, three times higher than shrimps
and prawns, and about similar to lamb [@Clune2017].

When it comes to water footprint, the situation is more nuanced. There
are three types of water that must be taken into account, namely blue
water (surface- and groundwater), green water (rainwater) and gray water
(surface- and groundwater that has been polluted) [@Gerbens-Leenes2013].
While the global average water footprint of beef per kilo produced is
higher than for other animals(2.6 times more than pork, 3.6 times more
than chicken [@Mekonnen2012]), if green water is excluded the water
footprint of beef is similar to that of pork and chicken
[@Gerbens-Leenes2013]. The global average total water footprint per kilo
produced of beef is 21.8 times higher than vegetables, 9.4 times higher
than cereals, 3.8 times higher than pulses and 1.7 times higher than
nuts. When removing green water, beef has 5.4 times the water footprint
of vegetables, 2.4 times the water footprint of cereals, 1.1 the water
footprint of pulses, and 0.5 the water footprint of nuts [@Mekonnen2011;
@Mekonnen2012]. There is a lack of water footprint analyses of seafood,
but aquaculture in China has been found to have a similar blue and green
water footprint to global levels for chicken [@Gephart2017]. It is
however believed that the water footprint of aquaculture will increase
as fish feed increasingly includes more water intensive ingredients
[@Pahlow2015].

-   

-   Land use (Include that land use for animals include land used for
    feed.

-   Biodiversity - mention the monoculture problem

-   Included in the environmental impact of animal production is the
    environmental impact of growing feed. Currently 1/3 of all crops are
    used to feed animals. The rise of fish farming puts even more
    pressure on crop production as crops are increasingly part of fish
    feed as well [@Pahlow2015]. While ruminants can be fed roughage that
    are not edible for humans, non-ruminant (pork, chicken and farmed
    fish) feed consists of cereals that could feed humans
    [@Makkar2018].\
    and the increase of aquaculture will increase the need for crops for
    fish feed. In EAT Lancet it is proposed to increase food production
    without increasing land use, this might not be possible
    <https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/23840465/>

It is possible to produce food in a more sustainable manner. For example
for ruminant meat, mitigation strategies for GHGE include the use of
pasture and grazing techniques that improve soil carbon sequestration
[@Godde2020; @Willett2019; @Byrnes2018; @Cusack2021; @DeFigueiredo2017].
In some studies it is even shown that grazing management could lead to
net negative carbon emissions of the livestock at farm level
[@Stanley2018; @Viglizzo2019; @Salvador2017; @Gutierrez-Pena2019].
Finding sustainable ways to keep ruminants is especially important in
countries such as Norway where only three percent of the land is used as
farmland, and an even smaller area can be used for crops fit for human
consumption [@Knutsen2020].

When it comes to plants, locally field grown products are the most
sustainable. There are possible strategies to improve field growing even
further, such as intercropping or a rotating crop system. Intercropping,
growing two or more crops in close proximity such as legumes and oats
[@Tidaker2021] or lettuce and cucumbers [@Pereira2021], could reduce
GHGE of both species. Introducing legumes in a rotating crop system
reduce the subsequent crop's need for fertilizer [@Nemecek2008;
@Costa2020]. This could decrease climate impact by 12-21%
[@Tidaker2021]. However, field growing is not always possible due to
seasonal climate, and the use of heated greenhouses can increase GHGE of
a fruit or vegetable substantially. In such cases, importing the produce
from a region where it is in season might be the better option.
Tomatoes, aubergine, peppers and cucumbers grown locally in a heated
greenhouse could have up to a 100 times the GHGE than if they had been
imported from a country where they are in season and grown in fields
[@Theurl2014; @Frankowska2019; @Davis2011; @Ntinas2017]. It is however
important to think about how the produce is transported. For example
long haul air-freighting of peas into UK from non European countries has
nearly 59 times higher GHGE than the use of heavy goods vehicles to
transport peas to UK from EU countries [@Michalsky2015].

Production of nuts has higher GHGE than cereals and legumes, but still
considerably less than animal based foods. However there are limited
studies on the GHGE of nut production [@Clune2017]. Besides GHGE, nuts
have a large water footprint and 74 % of nuts produced today are
produced under blue water stress, 63 % under severe water stress
[@Vanham2020]. Per kilo produced, almonds, pistachios, hazelnuts and
walnuts have the same water footprint as meat from beef [@Vanham2020].

For seafood, fish caught offshore by trawling or long line fishing has
higher GHGE than fish caught closer to the coast [@Clune2017]. Lobsters,
shrimp and prawn may under certain circumstances have as high an impact
as ruminants, while pollock and herring on the other end is comparable
to tree-nuts and cereals [@Clune2017]. The majority of marine fish comes
from sustainable fished stocks without overfishing, but there are
geographical differences
[@FoodandAgricultureOrganizationoftheUnitedNations2020] (p7-8). About 50
% of seafood consumed globally comes from aquaculture, and production is
expanding [@FoodandAgricultureOrganizationoftheUnitedNations2020] p6).
Feed for aquaculture are primarily based on wild caught forage fish, and
this has raised concerns about overfishing and the collapse of aquatic
food webs [@Naylor2009]. Farming of Atlantic Salmon has especially high
demands of marine feed sources [@Naylor2009]. Alternative feed sources
are crops, but this will increase pressure on freshwater resources
[@Pahlow2015], and compete with crop production for human consumption
[@Makkar2018].

Another aspect is the difference between organic and conventional
farming. While there are different certification systems for classifying
a farm as an organic farm, there is typically a focus on animal and
plant diversity, crop rotations, soil quality and animal welfare, and
avoiding prophylactic use of antibiotics and most synthetic pesticides
and fertilizers [@Reganold2016]. Meta-analyses have found improved soil
quality, higher biodiversity and lower energy use on organic farms, but
that organic farms often use more land, and due to lower yields
generally have higher GHGE per kilo product than conventional farms
[@Reganold2016]. However, concerns have been raised that typical LCAs
fail to adequately assess the full environmental impact of organic
farming, and that results may be to overestimate acidification,
eutrophication and global warming potential while downplaying the
benefits of organic farming [@Meier2015].

Lastly, there is the food packaging. The use of tin cans and glass jars
for packaging have higher environmental impact than cartons and plastic
[@Brock2020; @Stefanini2021]. While plastic may have a low GHGE, plastic
from food packaging is the major source of plastic waste that pollutes
the environment [@Ncube2020].

In short, there are numerous concerns an environmentally conscious
consumer must take into account. Many of the details mentioned, such as
type of feed used for livestock, if a vegetable is grown in a field or
in a heated greenhouse and the type of transportation used during
distribution may not be easily accessible to the consumer when shopping.
Additional concerns not mentioned here are farm worker and animal
welfare, and cultural and socioeconomic aspects of food choices
[@Jarmul2019]. Also, while some foods can have a low environmental
impact compared to ruminant meat, they could be with no nutritional
value. Growing and producing nutrient poor foods takes away resources
that could be used for better purposes.

To combat malnutrition at both population and individual level, many
countries and regions have developed regional/national food based
dietary guidelines (FBDGs) that provide nutritional advice for how to
eat to get adequate energy and nutrients to stay healthy
[@Herforth2019]. In recent updates of FBDGs, the countries Sweden
[@SwedishFood], Denmark [@Fødevarestyrelsen], Netherlands [@Brink2019],
France [@FoodandAgricultureOrganizationoftheUnitedNations] and Qatar
[@Seed2015] have also included that the recommended diet should have a
low environmental impact. Environmental impact will also be included in
the new Nordic Nutritional Recommendations (NNR) for 2022, that will be
used as a basis for FBDGs in the Nordic and Baltic countries
[@Helsedirektoratetc].

## Dietary guidelines

There are more than 100 countries in the world that either has or is
developing a FBDG [@FoodandAgricultureOrganizationoftheUnitedNationsa].
These guidelines are developed by looking at the science on diet and
health, and translating it into guidelines for healthy eating that fits
the national context. Among other things this means taking into account
which foods are available and culturally acceptable in that
country/region, that can be eaten to supply the body with the nutrients
it needs. Even though there are differences between countries and
regions, FBDGs around the world share similarities such as
recommendations to eat high quality whole foods within one's energy
requirements, include a variety of colorful vegetables (starchy roots
and tubers are generally not counted as a vegetable in these instances)
and fruit and other fiber rich foods such as whole grain cereals,
legumes and nuts, consume marine omega-3 fatty acids and have a low
intake of processed foods, saturated fat, added sugar and salt
[@Herforth2019].

The recommendations to consume FVs, whole grain cereals, legumes and
nuts indicates that even if not all FBDGs have incorporated
environmental sustainability as part of their development, they are
still sustainable. Following a predominantly plant based diet with low
to moderate consumption of animal based foods is an advice commonly
given to consumers that want to be environmentally friendly, while still
eating healthy [@Willett2019; @SwedishFood; @Fødevarestyrelsen;
@Brink2019; @Seed2015]. Animal sourced foods are generally nutrient
dense, and they are not required in large amounts in the diet to provide
necessary nutrients for good health [@Willett2019]. If eliminating
animal based foods completely, special focus must be placed on vitamin
B12, vitamin A, iodine, zinc, calcium and selenium as these nutrients
are either not present in plant based foods (vitamin B12) or more
difficult to obtain [@Bakaloudi2021; @Kristensen2015]. Other advice
presented in FBDGs that include environmental impact is to eat local,
seasonal produce and choose organic if possible, and to reduce intake of
meat and of nutrient poor foods such as confectionery.

FBDGs are often presented to consumers with images that show various
food groups and their proportion in relation to each other in a healthy
diet. An example is the Norwegian "diet circle" that can be seen in
**Figure** \@ref(fig:kostholdssirkelen).

```{r kostholdssirkelen, fig.cap = "The Norwegian diet circle, an illustration of how various food groups should contribute to a healthy Norwegian diet[@Helsedirektoratetb]."}
knitr::include_graphics("images/kostsirkelen.PNG")
```

Some guidelines also include how much of total energy (E%) should come
from the three macronutrients fat, protein and carbohydrates, and
subgroups such as saturated fat and added sugar. For example, the NNR
recommends that 25-40 E% should come from fats, 10-20 E% should come
from protein and 45-60 E% should come from carbohydrates. Additionally
they state that \<10 E% should come from either saturated fat or added
sugar [@NordicCouncilofMinisters2014](p.25-29). WHO guidelines has the
same recommendations for saturated fat and added sugar, but has slight
variations in the macronutrient recommendations, stating that 15-30 E%
should come from fat, 10-15 E% from protein and 55-75 E% from
carbohydrates [@WorldHealthOrganization2003](p.56).

By following the FBDGs, an individual should meet their recommended
dietary intake (RDI) of all nutrients, and thus support their good
health and well-being. However, many studies have found that adherence
to national FBDGs is low, especially when it comes to intake of healthy
and sustainable foods such as FVs, legumes, whole grain cereals, nuts
and seeds, fish and dairy, and for unhealthy foods high in sugar, salt
and/or saturated fat [@Valen2020; @Derbyshire2018; @Leme2021;
@Brettschneider2021; @Kristjansdottir2009; @Bel2019; @AlThani2018]. This
pattern is seen in all age groups, genders and socioeconomic groups, but
lower adherence is more prevalent in lower socioeconomic groups. Low
adherence is associated with increased risk of malnutrition and its
associated diseases.

In Denmark, higher adherence to the Danish FBDG has been associated with
lower risk of developing NCDs such as type II diabetes and stroke
[@Markanti2020; @Hansen2018a; @Hansen2018]. In the Netherlands, one
study found that higher adherence to the national FBDG was associated
with lower mortality, and lower risk of developing the NCDs stroke,
chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and colorectal cancer, but not
type II diabetes, coronary heart disease, heart failure, dementia,
breast or lung cancer [@Voortman2017]. Another study found that high
adherence to the Dutch FBDGs were associated with lower risk of type II
diabetes [@DenBraver2020]. Due to many confounding factors when it comes
to diet and health, such as socioeconomic status, and the difficulty of
measuring dietary intake, it is not surprising to see different results
in such studies. Still, there is wide consensus that a higher adherence
to healthy dietary habits such as following national FBDGs would lower
disease burden of individuals globally and substantially decrease health
costs [@Schulze2018; @McCullough2014; @USDA2014]. The Institute for
Health Metrics and Evaluation has in their Global Burden of Disease
series quantified how low adherence to different advice found in FBDGs
contribute to mortality and disease risk in 195 countries [@Afshin2019].
Both globally and in most of the included countries, the leading causes
of diet related mortality and DALYs were high salt intake and low intake
of whole grain cereals, fruit, nuts and seeds and vegetables. By
improving these dietary patterns, the diet would also improve
environmental sustainability.

It is beyond the scope of this thesis to include a comprehensive review
of the literature on the systemic and individual factors that underlie
food choice that in turn influence the healthiness and sustainability of
ones diet, but for a more thorough discussion of the science, please
read the review by Chen and Antonelli [@Chen2020]. In short, the
availability, accessibility and affordability of healthy foods in the
environment, together with individual food preferences, cultural norms
and knowledge of the relationship between diet and health all play a
role.

There are several sources of dietary information available to the
general consumer. Concerns have been raised that contradictory messaging
on diet and health, for example in news media, cause confusion and lower
intentions to follow healthy dietary advice [@Lee2018b; @Clark2019;
@Nagler2014; @Vijaykumar2021]. These concerns could also apply to making
food choices with low environmental impact.

To avoid what is known as "nutrition confusion", the population must
have nutritional literacy: "the ability to critically analyze nutrition
information, increase awareness and participate in action to address
barriers to healthy eating behaviors." [@Guttersrud2014; @Cornish2015].
Low nutritional literacy, which typically includes difficulty finding
and interpreting reliable nutrition information, has been associated
with low adherence to healthy dietary habits [@Taylor2019; @Kalkan2019;
@Hill2020; @Liao2019].

To help consumers make informed, healthy dietary choices when shopping
for foods, WHO recommends the use of front-of-pack (FOP) nutrition
labels, that provide consumers with easy to understand nutrition
information at a glance [@WorldHealthOrganization2014;
@WorldHealthOrganization2013; @WorldHealthOrganizaton2016]. There also
exists some FOP labels to help consumers make sustainable food choices
[@Liu2016; @Cornish2020; @Meyerding2019; @Grunert2014].

## Front of pack labels

### Nutrition labels

In 2019 there were over 30 countries around the world that have endorsed
the use of FOP nutrition labels as a tool to make it easier for
consumers to choose healthier food options [@Jones2019]. In most
countries the use of these labels by food manufacturers and retail is
voluntary, but a few countries including Chile, South Korea, Mexico and
Finland have mandatory FOP nutrition labels [@Jones2019]. There are two
groups of FOPs, summary labels and nutrient-specific labels
[@Temple2020]. In both groups, qualifying (i.e. healthy) and
disqualifying (i.e. unhealthy) components are used to decide on a food's
healthiness. Summary labels use a set of criteria that can be turned
into an algorithm to decide a food's healthiness, while
nutrient-specific labels showcase the amount of the various
qualifying/disqualifying components in the food per 100 g/per serving.
Typically the nutrients fat, saturated fat, sodium (or salt) and added
sugar are seen as disqualifying components, while protein, fibre and
omega-3 fatty acids are seen as qualifying. The addition of fruits,
vegetables, nuts, legumes and healthy fats such as olive and nut oils is
also qualifying in some criteria. Some FOPs uses a mix of disqualifying
and qualifying components to decide if a food is healthy or not, while
others use only one or the other [@VanderBend2019; @Temple2020].

There is also a difference in what message is conveyed. The Scandinavian
Keyhole is a single mark summary label that is given to foods that are a
healthier option in their given product category, such as ready-made
meals or breads. For the Keyhole there are different thresholds of
disqualifying (energy, fat, saturated fat, trans fat, sodium and sugar)
and qualifying components (energy, fibre, fruits, vegetables, nuts,
legumes) per 100 g for what it takes to receive the label depending on
product category, and some product categories such as soft drinks cannot
receive the label at all [@VanderBend2019, @Helsedirektoratet2015]. The
Multiple Traffic Light System used in the UK is a nutrient-specific
label that only include disqualifying components (fat, saturated fat,
sodium and added sugar), and the same threshold values for the various
components is used on all food categories. The Multiple Traffic Light
System presents the consumer with the values of each disqualifying
component per 100 g/per serving in grams and percentage of the daily
amount one should eat, color coded with either green for "low", amber
for "medium", or red for "high" [@VanderBend2019]. Consumers are advised
to choose foods with more green and amber than red
[@BritishNutritionFoundation2019]. Yet another type of FOP is the
Nutriscore, that originated in France and is now used in many countries
in Europe. Like the Keyhole label, the Nutriscore is a summary label
that uses both disqualifying (energy, saturated fat, sodium, added
sugar) and qualifying components (protein, fibre, fruits, vegetables,
nuts, legumes, olive oil, nut oil, rapeseed oil) per 100 g/100 ml of a
food/drink. However, where the Keyhole is a single mark given to foods
that comply the given set of criteria, the Nutriscore is a gradient from
A (dark green, healthy) to E (dark orange, less healthy), where the
value of the specific food is highlighted [@VanderBend2019;
@Chantal2017; @SantePubliqueFrance2021; @SantePubliqueFrance2021a].
Originally the Nutriscore was used as-is on all food product categories,
but it was changed to have specific criteria for fats and dairy. The
design of the mentioned FOPs can be seen in **Figure**
\@ref(fig:nutritionlabels).

```

These labels provide simplified dietary information and are accessible
to the consumer when making dietary choices while food shopping. Another
potential consequence of the mandatory use of FOP nutrition labels, is
that manufacturers improve the healthiness of their products to be able
to receive a FOP label. Indeed, a recent meta analysis found that the
use of FOP nutrition labels influence consumers to reduce their intake
of energy and fat, and increase their intake of vegetables. At the same
time, it was found that food manufacturers reduced the amount of
sodium/salt in their product formulas [@Shangguan2019]. The European
Academy of Paediatrics and the European Childhood Obesity Group have
called for a uniform, mandatory FOP nutrition label use in the European
Union to help mitigate the rising obesity trend in European children and
adolescents [@Deren2021].

There are of course other interventions and tools that governments,
together with the industry and non-profit organizations use to improve
dietary choices of general consumers, such as promotional campaigns and
regulatory restrictions and mandates, but such interventions would be
outside the scope of this thesis. For a review please read Russo et al
[@Russo2020].

### Sustainability labels

Sustainability labels are not as much used as nutrition labels, but
labeling schemes exist for foods that are organic, local, come from
sustainable fisheries, have high animal welfare or worker's rights,
and/or a low carbon footprint [@Liu2016; @Cornish2020;
@MarineStewardshipCouncil; @Meyerding2019]. Recently, retailers in
France have developed a sustainability label for their geographical
region in line with the summary Nutriscore, that has both qualifying
(environmental benefits such as organic or local production) and
disqualifying (packaged in non--recyclable packaging, has ingredients
with negative environmental impacts such as lowered biodiversity)
properties [@ecoscore-criteria]. In the UK, Foundation Earth has
developed a sustainability label after the model of nutrient-specific
labels [@foundation-earth].

There is uncertainty if sustainability labels improve the sustainability
of consumer's food choices [@Liu2016; @DeBauw2021; @Grunert2014].

## Meals, not guidelines or labels

While dietary guidelines and FOP labels can help individuals make
healthy, and perhaps sustainable, food choices, foods are seldom bought
to be eaten in isolation. Rather, they are bought to be part of meals.
Consumers find inspiration for what meals to cook in various sources,
such as cookbooks and on the Internet [@Doub2016]. Some recipe sources,
like the popular recipe site Allrecipes.com, provide users with
nutrition information. In the case of Allrecipes.com this is the amount
of calories and percentage of RDI of macro- and micronutrients per
serving [@allrecipes-nutrition].

Several studies have looked at how well recipes found in cookbooks
[@Irwin2017; @Howard2012], supermarket magazines [@Wademan2020], food
blogs [@Schneider2013; @Keogh2019; @Dickinson2018] or other Internet
sources such as recipe sites [@Trattner2017a] compare to dietary
guidelines and/or FOP labeling schemes. Results are sobering, as most
recipes studied do not comply with healthy dietary principles. To date,
I am not aware of any study on these kinds of recipes sustainability.

## Thesis aims

This thesis aims to look at a selection of recipes from three countries
(UK, Norway, US), from cookbooks (UK) and the Internet (Norway, US), and
compare their health and sustainability.

RQ1: How sustainable are recipes from these countries?

RQ2: Do sustainability indicators correlate with healthiness indicators?

RQ3: Do sustainability indicators correlate with micronutrient content?
