# Background

Not only are unhealthy diets that lead to malnutrition believed to be responsible for one in five adult deaths and 15% of the total adult disability adjusted life years (DALYs) globally [@Afshin2019], but our current food system, i.e. how we produce, distribute and process food items, is also taking its toll on the environment. Globally, food production accounts for 70% of fresh water resources [@Shukla2019](p5), 42-61% of land resources [@Shukla2019](p6) and 21-37% of total greenhouse gas emissions (GHGE) [@Crippa2021]. Additionally there is growing awareness of how food production can negatively impact biodiversity, increase soil degradation and pollute air, water and land [@Benton2021; @RodriguezEugenio2018; @Domingo2021; @Kopittke2019]. This is made even worse by the fact that about a third of all food produced in the world is either lost or wasted through the supply-chain or at the consumer. Food waste is the third largest contributor to the world's GHGEs [@FoodandAgricultureOrganizationoftheUnitedNations2013], and accounts for 23-24% of freshwater, land and fertilizer used in food production [@Kummu2012]. The EAT-Lancet Commission on Food, Planet, Health states that food production is the largest cause of global environmental change [@Willett2019]. With a growing human population, if current trends in production and consumption patterns continue, more people will end up malnourished and the stress on the environment will increase.

This is the background for the need to develop diets that are both healthy and environmentally sustainable, so called "Sustainable Healthy Diets". The World Health Organization (WHO) and the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO) defines a sustainable healthy diet as dietary patterns that "promote all dimensions of individuals' health and well being; have low environmental pressure and impact; are accessible, affordable, safe and equitable; and are culturally acceptable." [@FoodandAgricultureOrganizationoftheUnitedNations2019]

An interesting source of data on food sustainability are recipes. As a common source of information and inspiration, recipes can be used to study how various foods are combined by consumers. This can provide insight into food combinations that are in alignment with sustainable diet principles, and the relationship between the various aspects of sustainability included in this concept. 

## The environmental impact of food

An environmentally sustainable food system is defined by FAO as a system which effect "on the surrounding natural environment are neutral or positive, taking into consideration biodiversity, water, soil, animal and plant health, the carbon footprint, the water footprint, food loss and waste, and toxicity." [@Food2018]

Most research that has been done on the environmental impact of different foods have focused on GHGE. Increased GHGE cause climate change, which with various degrees of certainty will result in sea level rise, ocean acidification, increased temperature and more extreme weather events such as floods and droughts [@Masson-Delmotte2021]. Among the many issues this can cause, is poorer yield and nutrition value of crops and livestock products, and in turn worse nutrition status of humans [@Hatfield2011; @Rojas-Downing2017]. With this in mind, sustainability is now an important consideration for food security, the physical and economical access individuals have to nutritious and safe foods [@Shukla2019; @Gustafson2016].

The environmental impact of foods are commonly found through life cycle assessments (LCAs), a "compilation and evaluation of the inputs, outputs, and potential environmental impacts of a product system throughout its life cycle." [@Cucurachi2019] The input in an LCA for a food product could be the raw materials used to produce farm equipment, the energy source used for heating a greenhouse or powering a tractor, the resources used to make fertilizer or feed, and how the food is packaged, distributed, processed and finally how any waste produced is handled. The result is the environmental impact (GHGE, land use, water footprint, eutrophication, acidification and/or others) per output functional unit of the food. The functional unit varies, but could be the kilo of food produced at the farm, or that reaches the consumer. Other functional units used are amounts of energy, protein and various micronutrients produced, or hectares of land used to produce a given amount of product. There are no standardized method to perform an LCA of a food, so it can be difficult to compare results between studies that have performed LCAs with various inputs, outputs and type of environmental impact.

In general, production at the farm contributes the most to a food's environmental impact, while distribution, packaging, processing, preparation and waste removal is less important [@Crippa2021; @Ledgard2010; @EulalioNeto2021].

There are however huge variations both within and between the same foods and food groups (see **Figure** \@ref(fig:environmental-impacts)). Details such as geographical location and available local resources, seasonality, herd size and production capacity for animals, outdoor or indoor production system, energy sources used for production, type of fertilizer and/or pest control used for crops and type of feed used for animals (crops that are edible for humans or not) can all influence the environmental impact of a given food. For example, vegetables produced locally may have lower environmental impact than imported produce when in season and grown in fields, but out of season the vegetables might be grown in heated greenhouses that has a higher environmental cost than transportation from a region where they are produced in season. A food could also be environmentally sustainable when looking at one type of environmental impact, but harmful when looking at another. For example, nuts have a high water footprint while their GHGE is relatively low.

```

### Difference between food groups

Multiple studies have found that industrial meat production from ruminants is the largest contributor to GHGE and land use in the agriculture sector [@Clune2017; @Phelps2017; @Mertens2019]. Per kilo produced, median GHGE from beef is 71 times higher than in season field grown vegetables, 53 times higher than cereals and legumes, 22 times higher than tree nuts, eight times higher than fish, seven times higher than chicken, five times higher than pork, three times higher than shrimps and prawns, and about similar to lamb [@Clune2017].

The situation is more nuanced when it comes to the water footprint. There are three types of water that must be taken into account, namely blue water (surface- and groundwater), green water (rainwater) and gray water (surface- and groundwater that has been polluted) [@Gerbens-Leenes2013]. Around the world, scarcity of blue and green water varies [@Rosa2020; @Schyns2019], and it depends on the region if production of food overtaxes water availability. While the global average total water footprint of beef per kilo produced is higher than for other animals (2.6 times more than pork, 3.6 times more than chicken [@Mekonnen2012]), if green water is excluded the water footprint of beef is similar to that of pork and chicken [@Gerbens-Leenes2013]. The global average total water footprint per kilo produced of beef is 21.8 times higher than vegetables, 9.4 times higher than cereals, 3.8 times higher than pulses and 1.7 times higher than nuts. When removing green water, beef has 5.4 times the water footprint of vegetables, 2.4 times the water footprint of cereals, about the same water footprint as pulses, and half the water footprint of nuts [@Mekonnen2011; @Mekonnen2012]. There is a lack of water footprint analyses of seafood, but aquaculture in China has been found to have a similar blue and green water footprint to global levels for chicken [@Gephart2017].

Of land used for agriculture, about 75% is used for pastures, while the remaining 25% is used for croplands [@Shukla2019] (p6). The median area of land used to produce one kilo of fat and bone free meat of beef is 568 times higher than a kg of assorted vegetables, 30.4 that of farmed fish, 19.6 times more than nuts, 15.5 times that of poultry, 14 times that of pulses, 12.7 that of pork and 1.3 times that of lamb [@Poore2018a].

It should be kept in mind that when looking at environmental impact per kilo of food produced, the amount and type of various nutrients the food provide to the diet is not taken into account. A food could have a high environmental impact per kilo, but only be needed in small amounts to supply the necessary nutrients for good health.

Turning natural land into croplands or pasture is the principal cause of habitat loss of wild species, which in turn is associated with loss of biodiversity [@Benton2021]. The expanding use of natural lands may lead to an increased exposure to infectious pathogens from animals, in worst case leading to future pandemics [@Wilkinson2018; @Patz2004; @Wolfe2007; @Dobson2020]. Water used for farming also shunts water away from natural ecosystems. Runoff, excess nutrients from fertilizer, can end up in rivers and other water systems leading to eutrophication, the overgrowth of algae at the expense of other species. The use of pesticides to grow crops is also associated with loss of biodiversity [@Benton2021]. Organic farming practices have been shown to be less damaging to biodiversity than conventional farming, but produce lower yields so that per functional unit produced GHGE, water footprint and land use is higher [@Reganold2016]. However, concerns have been raised that typical LCAs fail to adequately assess the full environmental impact of organic farming, and that results may be to overestimate acidification, eutrophication and global warming potential while downplaying the benefits [@Meier2015].

Included in LCAs of livestock production, including farmed seafood, is the environmental impact of growing feed. Currently a third of all crops grown are used to feed livestock. While ruminants can be fed roughage that are not edible for humans, non-ruminants (pork, chicken and farmed fish) feed consists of cereals that could feed humans [@Makkar2018; @Pahlow2015]. The rise of fish farming means that more crops will be grown for fish feed in the future, likely leading to an increase of farmed fish's water and land footprint [@Pahlow2015]. However, the increased use of crops in fish feed has come about in part due to overfishing of marine ingredients used in the feed, and the use of crops reduce the strain on these marine resources.

Additional concerns not mentioned here, but still important for sustainable farming systems, are farm worker and animal welfare, and cultural and socioeconomic aspects of food choices [@Jarmul2020].

While many countries and regions have long since developed regional/national food based dietary guidelines (FBDGs) that provide nutritional advice for how to eat to get adequate energy and nutrients to stay healthy [@Herforth2019], it is only recently that FBDGs have been developed that also take environmental impact into account.

## Dietary guidelines

There are more than 100 countries in the world that either have or are developing a FBDG [@FoodandAgricultureOrganizationoftheUnitedNationsa]. These guidelines are developed by reviewing relevant studies on diet and health, and translating it into guidelines for healthy eating that fits the national context. Among other things this means taking into account which foods are available and culturally acceptable in that country/region, that can be eaten to supply the body with the nutrients it needs and not cause ill health. In the latest FBDG update from Brazil [@BrazilDietaryGuidelines2015], Canada [@HealthCanada2019], Denmark [@Foedevarestyrelsen], France [@FoodandAgricultureOrganizationoftheUnitedNations], Germany [@Schafer2021], Netherlands [@Brink2019], Sweden [@SwedishFood], and Qatar [@Seed2015] individuals are not only advised on how to eat a healthy diet, but also an environmentally sustainable one. Environmental impact will also be included in the new Nordic Nutrition Recommendations (NNR) for 2022, that will be used as a basis for FBDGs in the Nordic and Baltic countries [@Helsedirektoratetc]. It is likely that even more countries are working on this.

Even though there are differences between countries and regions, FBDGs around the world share similarities such as qualitative recommendations to eat high quality whole foods within one's energy requirements, include a variety of colorful vegetables (starchy roots and tubers are generally not counted as a vegetable in these instances) and fruit and other fiber rich foods such as whole grain cereals, legumes and nuts, consume fish and dairy foods, and have a low intake of processed foods, saturated fat, added sugar and salt [@Herforth2019]. This is also true of other healthy dietary patterns, such as the Mediterranean diet [@Davis2015a] or the New Nordic diet [@Mithril2012]. These foods are highlighted as they contribute important nutrients to the diet. To make it easier to know how much to consume to get health benefits, recommendations can also be quantitative by defining number of portions and/or portion sizes. A well known example is to eat five portions of fruits and vegetables a day. In high income countries, it is also common to include a maximum red meat intake, like \<500 grams/week. A few countries advice that home cooking and cooking skills are beneficial for healthy dietary habits [@BrazilDietaryGuidelines2015; @TheJapanDieteticAssociation; @HealthCanada2019].

FBDGs are often presented to consumers with images that show various food groups and their proportion in relation to each other in a healthy diet. An example is the Norwegian "diet circle" that can be seen in **Figure** \@ref(fig:kostholdssirkelen).

```{r kostholdssirkelen, out.width = "80%", fig.cap = "The Norwegian diet circle, an illustration of how various food groups should contribute to a healthy Norwegian diet [@Helsedirektoratetb]."}
knitr::include_graphics("images/kostsirkelen.PNG")
```

The largest food groups in such visualizations are starchy staples like grains and grain-based products, starchy roots and tubers, fruit and vegetables and legumes [@Herforth2019]. These food groups provide, among a multitude of beneficial micronutrients and other compounds, carbohydrates to the diet in the form of starch, sugar and fiber. The importance of these foods is also reflected in different guidelines recommendations for macronutrient intake, where recommended energy intake (E%) from carbohydrate is relatively high compared to the other energy-providing macronutrients protein and fat [@Buyken2018].

Following a predominantly plant-based diet rich in whole grains, legumes, nuts, fruit and vegetables with low to moderate consumption of animal sourced foods is an advice commonly given to consumers that want to be environmentally friendly, while still eating healthy [@Willett2019; @SwedishFood; @Foedevarestyrelsen; @Brink2019; @Seed2015]. Although in the case of water footprint it might be that reducing animal sourced foods lead to a lower total water footprint, but not necessarily a lower blue water footprint [@Harris2020], putting strain on water scarce areas. This is especially true when animal sourced foods is reduced while intake of water intensive nuts is increased, made worse by the fact that most nuts are grown in areas with water scarcity [@Vanham2020].

Animal sourced foods are generally nutrient dense, and they are not required in large amounts in the diet to provide necessary nutrients for good health [@Willett2019]. If eliminating animal sourced foods completely, as when following a vegan diet, special focus must be placed on vitamin B12, vitamin B2, vitamin D, iodine, zinc, calcium and selenium as these nutrients are either not present in plant-based foods (vitamin B12) or more difficult to obtain [@Bakaloudi2021]. Other advice presented in FBDGs that include environmental impact is to eat local, seasonal produce and choose organic if possible, and to reduce intake of discretionary and nutrient poor foods such as confectionery.

By following national FBDGs, an individual should meet their recommended dietary intake (RDI) of all nutrients, and thus support their good health and well-being. However, many studies have found that adherence to FBDGs is low, especially when it comes to intake of healthy and relatively sustainable foods such as fruit and vegetables, legumes, whole grain cereals, nuts and seeds, fish and dairy, and for unhealthy foods high in sugar, salt and/or saturated fat [@Valen2020; @Derbyshire2018; @Leme2021; @Brettschneider2021; @Kristjansdottir2009; @Bel2019; @AlThani2018; @VerlyJunior2013; @HopeAbel2021]. This pattern is seen in all age groups, genders and socioeconomic groups, but lower adherence to FBDGs is more prevalent in lower socioeconomic groups. Low adherence is associated with increased risk of malnutrition and associated diseases. In 2013 FAO estimated that the costs of malnutrition in the world could be as high as US \$3.5 trillion [@AgricultureandEconomicDevelopmentAnalysisDivision2013].

There is wide consensus that a higher adherence to healthy dietary habits such as following national FBDGs would lower disease burden of individuals globally and substantially decrease health costs [@Schulze2018; @McCullough2014; @USDA2014], but also reduce environmental impact of our diet [@Kovacs2021; @Steenson2021]. The Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation has in their Global Burden of Disease series quantified how low adherence to different advice found in FBDGs contribute to mortality and disease risk in 195 countries [@Afshin2019]. Both globally and in most of the included countries, the leading causes of diet related mortality and DALYs were high salt intake and low intake of low environmental foods such as whole grain cereals, fruit, nuts and seeds and vegetables. Additionally, on a global level the consumption of high environmental impact meat is higher than what is needed for good health [@Leme2021]. However, while many high-income countries would benefit from a lower intake of meat, in other parts of the world an increase in meat intake could be beneficial due to poor nutritional status in the population [@Willett2019; @Adesogan2020].

There are several sources of dietary information available to the general consumer. Concerns have been raised that contradictory messaging on diet and health, for example in news media, cause confusion and lower intentions to follow healthy dietary advice [@Lee2018a; @Clark2019; @Nagler2014; @Vijaykumar2021]. To make good dietary choices, the population must have nutritional literacy: "the ability to critically analyze nutrition information, increase awareness and participate in action to address barriers to healthy eating behaviors." [@Guttersrud2014; @SpiteriCornish2015]. Low nutritional literacy, which typically includes difficulty finding and interpreting reliable nutrition information, has been associated with low adherence to healthy dietary habits [@Taylor2019; @Kalkan2019; @Hill2020; @Liao2019]. These concerns could also apply to making food choices with low environmental impact, especially as consumers tend to associate healthiness with environmental sustainability [@VanLoo2017; @Grunert2020; @Barone2019; @Verain2016].

### Consumer beliefs about sustainable diets

Many studies have shown that few consumers are aware of the environmental impact of meat, and to the extent a plant-based diet can reduce environmental impact [@Sanchez-Sabate2019].

A 2020 survey of over 27000 consumers in 27 EU member states found that 66% participants claim to "always" or "most of the time" eat a healthy and sustainable diet [@Grunert2020]. This is in stark contrast with findings on both the healthiness and environmental sustainability of our diets previously mentioned.

The European consumers in the survey associate sustainable diets first and foremost with healthy foods, but also with low use of pesticides, affordability, short supply chains and to a lesser extent low environmental impact. To eat a sustainable diet, consumers answered they should increase their intake of fruit and vegetables (58%), eat foods that are local and in season (47%), cook at home (43%), choose foods with low amounts of pesticides (43%) and avoid wasting food (42%). Only a third of participants answered that eating a sustainable diet would involve a reduced intake of meat, or an increased intake of high-fibre foods such as whole grain cereals, and only one quarter answered that a sustainable diet involved eating foods with a low CO~2~ (a greenhouse gas) footprint [@Grunert2020].

Norwegian consumers believe that reducing food waste and eating more locally produced food is most beneficial to the environment, while eating organic or reducing meat intake was seen as the least beneficial contribution they could make [@Austgulen2018]. This is similar to UK consumers, who consider reduced consumption of air freighted foods, reduced food waste and increased use of local produce to have a high environmental benefit (believed by \>75%), while only 42% and 27% believe that is the case for plant-based protein and organic produce respectively [@Culliford2020]. Spaniards associate food sustainability with environmental impacts, biodiversity, local foods and GHGE. The majority of Spanish consumers have a negative view of the sustainability of processed foods (\~85%), while the opposite is true for fruit and vegetables. Meat is seen as positive for sustainability by about 50% [@Garcia-Gonzalez2020].

Brazilian consumers share many beliefs with Europeans when it comes to food sustainability. Sustainable diets in Brazil were associated with healthiness, plant-based and organic foods, environmental preservation and little food waste [@Barone2019]. There is a lack of studies on consumer perception and beliefs when it comes to sustainable diets in low-middle income countries, and countries outside of Europe. It is also difficult to compare studies and surveys on the topic as different themes and questions are explored.

While consumers may have some conceptions of what a sustainable diet is, studies show that environmental impact often ranks below other concerns such as taste, price, healthiness and animal welfare when consumers decide which food to buy [@Grunert2014; @Grunert2020; @Mann2018; @Clonan2015]. Still, in the health survey of the Norwegian population performed in 2020, 62% stated they had changed their diets to a lesser or greater degree in the last three years to lower its environmental impact [@HopeAbel2021], and in several high income countries intake of red meat has reduced in recent years which is believed to at least in part be due to environmental concerns [@Stewart2021; @Zeng2019; @OECDFAO2021].

It is beyond the scope of this thesis to include a comprehensive review of the literature on the systemic and individual factors that underlie food choice that in turn influence the healthiness and sustainability of ones diet, but for a more thorough discussion of the science, please read the review by Chen and Antonelli [@Chen2020]. In short, the availability, accessibility and affordability of healthy foods in the environment, together with individual food preferences, cultural norms and knowledge of the relationship between diet and health all play a role.

## Recipes in nutritional research

Cooking dinners at home has been associated with improved dietary quality and higher adherence to healthy dietary patterns like FBDGs [@Tiwari2017; @Mills2017; @Wolfson2020], although clinical relevance is uncertain. Still, as was seen in the survey by Grunert [@Grunert2020] more than 40% of European consumers believe cooking at home is part of a sustainable diet. Meal planning is also a tool consumers can use to reduce their food waste, and by that reduce the environmental impact and cost of their diets [@Principato2021]. While cooking at home and meal planning can be sustainable behaviors, it will depend on the meals that are prepared.

Consumers find inspiration for what meals to cook in various sources, such as cookbooks and on the Internet [@Doub2016]. Recipes from cookbooks, internet recipe sites, blogs and retailer magazines have garnered attention as they have a large reach and potential to influence food choice. Analysis of food and nutrient content in recipes have been suggested as a way to follow food trends and dietary patterns in a population [@Buisman2019; @Eidner2013], and to monitor the relationship between food consumption and health [@Trattner2017b]. This could also be true for the other domains of sustainable diets. Using recipes could be a less resource intensive method to gather dietary information than typically used food-frequency questionnaires, dietary interviews or food diaries. 

Several studies have looked at how well recipes found in cookbooks [@Irwin2017; @Howard2012; @Jones2013], supermarket magazines [@Wademan2020], food blogs [@Schneider2013; @Keogh2019; @Dickinson2018] or other Internet recipe sites [@Trattner2017a; @Jones2013; @Cheng2021] compare to dietary guidelines and/or other classification schemes for healthy meals such as various front of pack nutrition labeling systems. Results are sobering, as most recipes studied do not comply with healthy dietary principles as defined in these studies. Less is known about how recipes align with the other domains of sustainable diets.

## Thesis aims

This thesis aim to explore a selection of recipes from the United Kingdom (UK), Norway and the United States of America (US), from cookbooks (UK) and the Internet (Norway, US), and compare two domains of sustainable diets, namely health and environmental sustainability. To build on previous research on recipe's healthiness, micronutrient content will also be included in the analyses. The following research questions are asked:

1: How well do recipes from Norway, the UK and the US comply with healthy dietary guideline principles?

2: To what extent does a recipe's healthiness and environmental impact depend on country of origin?

3: To what extent does environmental impact correlate with healthiness?
