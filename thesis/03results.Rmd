# Results

## Data completeness

One Norwegian recipe was excluded from analysis as it contained no ingredients for which the amount in weight could be obtained. This was a recipe for "Fresh mackerel". Five additional Norwegian recipes were excluded as they were not dinner recipes.

For all three countries, the median percentage of the weight of the recipe that was mapped to a nutrient database or the SHARP Indicators database was 100, and the interquartile range was 100, 100. See **Appendix Figure** \@ref(fig:data-completeness).

Eight recipes (six Norwegian, two US) were not included in the analysis as \>10% of their ingredients in weight could not be mapped to the nutrient or SHARP Indicators database. The ingredients that contributed to this were sheep head, marrow bones, fish bones, bananas, plantains, pure gluten flour and tamarind juice, ingredients which would be expected to impact either the health or environmental sustainability outcomes.

## Recipes healthiness and environmental impact

Recipes scored better on the front of pack labeling criteria than the dietary guidelines. Only 0.5% recipes complied with all six WHO guidelines and 0.9% complied with all NNR guidelines, while 70.7% received an inverted Nutriscore \> -2 and 98.6% scored \>7 on the inverted FSA MTL. Table \@ref(tab:pct-recipe-healthiness) shows the number of recipes that received a specific score. The median score for WHO guideline compliance was 1 (IQR 1, 2), for NNR 2 (IQR 1, 3), inverted Nutriscore 0 (IQR -3, 2) and for the inverted MTL 9 (IQR 8, 10), see **Figure** \@ref(fig:all-health-env)A. The median kg CO~2~ equivalent emissions were 0.5 (IQR 0.3, 0.9) and the median m^2^ land used per year were 0.6 (IQR 0.3, 1.2), see **Figure** \@ref(fig:all-health-env)B.

```

**Figure** \@ref(fig:all-macros-cal) show the variables used to calculate the guideline scores: energy content, percentage of energy from each macronutrient and the amount of dietary fibre in g/megajoule for the recipes. For all but sugar content, the median percentage of energy or density per megajoule of these nutrients were outside the recommended intake range for both the WHO and NNR guidelines. The median energy content in kilocalories per 100g were 142.3 (IQR 105.2, 185.6). The macronutrient that contributed most to energy content was total fat, with a median percentage of energy of 48.0 (IQR 35.1, 58.8), followed by protein (median 23.2, IQR 18.1, 30.2) and carbohydrates (median 22.1, IQR 12.6, 35.7). The median percentage of energy from saturated fat was 16.4 (IQR 9.8, 23.0).

The energy contribution of added sugar was negligible in most recipes, but were \>25% in a handful, while the median dietary fibre in grams/megajoule were 1.9 (IQR 1.1, 3.0). In regards to dietary fibre, few recipes that had grains as an ingredient specified that whole grains should be used (not shown).

```

In terms of micronutrients, per 100g the recipes contributed most to percentage of RDI of vitamin B12 (median 25, IQR 10, 49.8), phosphorus (median 19, IQR 15, 23) and vitamin B6 (median 14, IQR 9, 20). On the other end, recipes contributed least to percentage of RDI of vitamin D (median 2, IQR 1, 7), iodine (median, 3 IQR 1, 5) and calcium (median 3, IQR 2, 7). Recipes contained more vitamin A in the form of retinol than beta-carotene. See **Figure** \@ref(fig:all-micros). For the micronutrients copper, iodine, selenium, sodium, phosphorus, vitamin A, D, E, B2 (riboflavin), B9 (folate) and B12 a handful of recipes could deliver more than the RDI per 100 g.

### Between countries comparison

Of the total 35 nutrients, healthiness and environmental sustainability indicators assessed, 21 were significantly different (BH adjusted *p*-value \<0.05) between at least two countries in the Kruskal-Wallis test, so a *post-hoc* Dunn test was performed.

Recipes from the UK scored significantly better than recipes from Norway (BH adjusted *p*-value \<0.01) and the US (BH adjusted *p*-value \<0.001) on the NNR guidelines and the inverted Nutriscore (BH adjusted *p*-value \<0.05). Norway scored significantly better than the US recipes in the inverted multiple traffic light model and the NNR guidelines (BH adjusted *p*-value \<0.05) **Figure** \@ref(fig:violinbox-healthiness).

```{r violinbox-healthiness, fig.cap = "The healthiness of the recipes based on the dietary guidelines from the World Health Organization and Nordic Nutritional Recommendations, and the inverted Multiple Traffic Light model from the UK and the inverted Nutriscore from France.", out.width="100%"}
knitr::include_graphics("images/violinbox_health_numerical.png")
```

Few recipes complied with WHO and NNR guideline criteria for carbohydrates, but more were compliant with NNR than WHO criteria. In a similar manner, more recipes were compliant with protein and total fat recommendations of the NNR than WHO. For dietary fibre, saturated fat and added sugar the guideline recommendations are identical. Protein contributed most to the qualifying scores on the Nutriscore, with the median score for protein being higher than the total median score of the disqualifying components. The scores for each component of the healthiness indicators by country, see **Figure** \@ref(fig:raw-score-guidelines), **Figure** \@ref(fig:raw-score-nutriscore) and **Figure** \@ref(fig:raw-score-trafficlights) for the guidelines, Nutriscore and the MTL respectively.

The US recipes had significantly higher CO~2~ emissions than recipes from both the UK (BH adjusted *p*-value \<0.01) and Norway (BH adjusted *p*-value \<0.05), and this was also the case for land requirements (BH adjusted *p*-value \<0.01) **Figure** \@ref(fig:violinbox-env-sustainability).

```{r violinbox-env-sustainability, fig.cap = "The environmental impact in kilo CO2 equivalents and m2 used per year per 100g of the recipes.", out.width="100%"}
knitr::include_graphics("images/violinbox_env_impact.png")
```

In terms of individual nutrients, the UK recipes were significantly higher in dietary fibre and vitamin C than both the US and Norwegian recipes (BH adjusted *p*-value \<0.001 and \<0.01 respectively) and significantly lower than the US recipes in protein content (BH adjusted *p*-value \<0.05). Norwegian recipes were significantly higher in vitamin B12 than both the US and the UK (BH adjusted *p*-value \<0.05). While there were other statistically significantly different micronutrients, in absolute numbers the difference between countries were negligible.

## Dinner meals as a source of nutrients

The majority of recipes were a source of at least one nutrient, with the most common nutrient being protein. Nearly all recipes from each country were considered a source of protein, and the majority were considered good sources of protein. Most recipes were also a source of phosphorus, and more than half of the recipes in each country were a source of vitamin B12. 

About twice the number of recipes from the UK were considered a source (41%) or a good source (9%) of dietary fibre compared to recipes from Norway or the US. There were also about twice the percentage of recipes from the UK compared to the other countries that were sources of Vitamin A (23%), both retinol and beta-carotene, vitamin C (44%), folate (7%), iron (8%) and magnesium (11%) although the percentage of recipes that were good sources were more similar between countries. Norway had more than twice the percentage of recipes than the UK or the US that were either a source (14%) or a good source (10%) of iodine, and also a higher percentage of recipes that were sources of selenium and Vitamin D.

Less than 10% of recipes from any country were sources of retinol, beta-carotene, riboflavin, folate, iron or potassium.

```

## Protein sources and amounts of different ingredients

Red meat (beef, lamb, game and pork) were the most used sources of protein in the recipes from all countries, while seafood (lean fish, oily fish and shellfish) were the second most used in the recipes from the UK and Norway and white meat (poultry) the second most used in the recipes from the US. Few recipes were vegan, and the UK had the most vegetarian recipes (**Figure** \@ref(fig:protein-sources-bar)).

```{r protein-sources-bar, fig.cap = "Percentage of recipes that used various animal protein sources, or were vegan or vegetarian.", out.width="100%"}
knitr::include_graphics("images/protein_source_bar.png")
```

Depending on protein source, the GHGE and landuse for the recipes varied. Recipes with beef, lamb, game and shellfish had the highes environmental impact. Vegetarian and vegan recipes had the lowest environmental impact, but the vegetarian recipes with the highest impact were on level with the meat based recipes (**Figure** \@ref(fig:protein-sources-violinbox)).

```{r protein-sources-violinbox, fig.cap = "Environmental impact in kilo CO2 equivalents and landuse in m2 per 100g in recipes with various protein sources.", out.width="100%"}
knitr::include_graphics("images/protein_source_violinbox.png")
```

Meat products followed by seafood, vegetables and starchy roots and tubers made up most of the weight of the recipes in which they were included. For recipes that included meat based products or vegetable products, recipes from the UK tended to include less meat and more vegetables than recipes from Norway and the US. There were small differences for other food groups **Figure** \@ref(fig:percent-foodgroups-weight).

```{r percent-foodgroups-weight, fig.cap = "How much various food groups contributed to the weight of the recipes in percent.", fig.width = 10, fig.asp = 0.75, out.width="100%"}

## Correlation analyses

### Healthiness indicators and environmental impact indicators

Results from the Spearman correlation showed a significant (BH adjusted *p*-value \<0.001) positive correlation between the four healthiness indicators. There was a moderate correlation between the two front of pack labels (rho 0.64, BH adjusted *p*-value \<0.001), and a strong correlation between the two dietary guidelines (rho 0.78, BH adjusted *p*-value \<0.001), while the correlation between the front of pack labels and the dietary guidelines were weaker. The two sustainability indicators had a significantly strong positive correlation (BH adjusted *p*-value \<0.001).

All four healthiness indicators were significantly (BH adjusted *p*-value \<0.001) negatively correlated with the two environmental sustainability indicators, with the two dietary guidelines being more strongly correlated with both GHGE and landuse than the FSA MTL and Nutriscore were. NNR had a slightly stronger correlation with both GHGE and landuse than WHO guidelines, while the Nutriscore had a weaker correlation with landuse than the FSA MTL. See **Figure** \@ref(fig:Correlation-healthVSsustainability).

```{r Correlation-healthVSsustainability, out.width = "100%", fig.cap = "Spearman's Rho between CO2 equivalents (kg), landuse (m2/year) and health indicators."}
knitr::include_graphics("images/healthVSsustainability.png")
```
\end{landscape}

### Environmental sustainability indicators and energy providing nutrients

There was a weak positive correlation between total energy content in kilocalories, fat, saturated fat, protein and environmental sustainability indicators when all recipes were pooled together (BH adjusted *p*-value \<0.01). This association did not reach statistical significance in all countries separately. There was a stronger correlation between saturated fat and environmental sustainability indicators than for total fat and environmental sustainability indicators.

Sugar was positively correlated with both environmental sustainability indicators in the pooled recipe data (BH adjusted *p*-value \<0.01). In both cases this was driven by recipes from the US, where sugar was used in many meat-based recipes as part of a condiment (not shown). There was a trend that sugar was positively correlated with GHGE but not landuse in the UK recipes.

Landuse had a weak negative correlation with carbohydrates (rho -0.42, BH adjusted *p*-value \<0.001) and dietary fibre (rho -0.31, BH adjusted *p*-value \<0.001). GHGE had a moderate negative correlation with carbohydrates (rho -0.47, BH adjusted *p*-value \<0.001) and a weak negative correlation with dietary fibre (rho -0.36, BH adjusted *p*-value \<0.001).

See **Figure** \@ref(fig:Correlation-energyVSsustainability) for details.

```
\end{landscape}

### Environmental sustainability indicators and mineral content

Many minerals were correlated with the environmental sustainability indicators, but the strength and significance of the correlations varied between countries.

There was a weak negative correlation between copper and GHGE (rho -0.1, BH adjusted *p*-value \<0.05). GHGE were positively correlated with Iron (rho 0.38, BH adjusted *p*-value \<0.001), phosphorus (rho 0.19, BH adjusted *p*-value \<0.001) and zinc (rho 0.67, BH adjusted *p*-value \<0.001). For copper the correlation was driven by recipes from the US. With iron the correlation was weaker for recipes from the UK than recipes from the US and Norway.

Landuse had a weak negative correlation (rho -0.16, BH adjusted *p*-value \<0.001) with calcium, iodine (rho -0.3, BH adjusted *p*-value \<0.001) and copper (rho -0.16, BH adjusted *p*-value \<0.001). The negative correlation between calcium and landuse was very low and did not reach significance in the Norwegian recipes. As with GHGE, the correlation between landuse and copper was driven by recipes from the US. Zinc were moderately positively correlated with landuse, while iron and phosphorus were weakly positively correlated with landuse. As with the correlations with GHGE, the correlation between landuse and iron were weaker in the UK recipes.

See **Figure** \@ref(fig:Correlation-mineralsVSsustainability1) and **Figure** \@ref(fig:Correlation-mineralsVSsustainability2).

\end{landscape}

### Environmental sustainability indicators and vitamin content

As with minerals, there were many vitamins that correlated with the environmental sustainability indicators, to various degrees of strength and significance.

GHGE had a weak negative correlation with folate (rho -0.27, BH adjusted *p*-value \<0.001), thiamine (rho -0.1, BH adjusted *p*-value \<0.05) vitamin C (rho -0.22, BH adjusted *p*-value \<0.001) and beta-carotene (rho -0.15, BH adjusted *p*-value \<0.001). For thiamine, the correlation was only significant in the pooled data. In all countries, there was a weak positive correlation between GHGE and niacin (rho 0.26, BH adjusted *p*-value \<0.001), riboflavin (rho 0.36, BH adjusted *p*-value \<0.38), vitamin B6 (rho 0.1, BH adjusted *p*-value \<0.05) and vitamin B12 (rho 0.36, BH adjusted *p*-value \<0.001). For the individual countries, the correlation between GHGE and vitamin B6 only reached significance in the recipe data from the UK, but there was a trend of the correlation moving in the same direction in the recipes from the US, but not Norway.

Correlation between the different vitamins and landuse generally followed the same pattern, but there was also a weak negative correlation between landuse and vitamin D content (rho -0.25, BH adjusted *p*-value \<0.001).
