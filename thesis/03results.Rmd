# Results

## Data completeness

### Missing amounts

One Norwegian recipe was excluded from analysis as it contained no ingredients for which the amount in kilos could be obtained. This was a recipe for "Fresh mackerel".

### Missing nutrition and environmental impact information

For all three countries, the median percentage of the weight of the recipe that was mapped to a nutrient database or the SHARP Indicators database was 100, and the interquartile range was 100, 100. See **Appendix Figure** \@ref(fig:data-completeness).

Eight recipes (six Norwegian, two US) were not included in the analysis as \>10% of their ingredients in weight could not be mapped to the nutrient or SHARP Indicators database. The ingredients that contributed to this were sheep head, marrow bones, fish bones, bananas, plantains, pure gluten flour and tamarind juice, ingredients which would be expected to impact either the health or environmental sustainability outcomes.

Four additional Norwegian recipes were excluded as they were not dinner recipes.

## Recipes healthiness and environmental impact

Recipes scored better on the meal/food-specific scoring criteria than the dietary guidelines. Only 0.5% recipes complied with all six WHO guidelines and 0.8% complied with all NNR guidelines, while 71.2% received a Nutriscore \> -2 and 98.8% scored \>7 on the inverted multiple traffic light system. The median score for WHO guideline compliance was 1 (IQR 1, 2), for NNR 2 (IQR 1, 3), inverted Nutriscore 0 (IQR -3, 2) and for the inverted traffic light 9 (IQR 8, 10), see **Figure** \@ref(fig:all-health-env)A. The median kg CO~2~ equivalent emissions were 0.5 (IQR 0.3, 0.9) and the median m^2^ land used per year were 0.6 (IQR 0.3, 1.2), see **Figure** \@ref(fig:all-health-env)B.

```

**Figure** \@ref(fig:all-macros-cal) show the variables used to calculate the guideline scores: energy content, percentage of energy from each macronutrient and the amount of dietary fibre in g/megajoule for the recipes. For all but sugar content, these nutrients were outside the recommended intake range for both the WHO and NNR guidelines. The median energy content in kilocalories per 100g were 141.4 (IQR 104.8, 184). The macronutrient that contributed most to energy content was total fat, with a median percentage of energy of 47.8 (IQR 35.0, 58.7), followed by protein (median 23.3, IQR 18.1, 30.7) and carbohydrates (median 22.1, IQR 12.4, 35.8). The median percentage of energy from saturated fat was 16.3 (IQR 9.8, 22.9).

The energy contribution of added sugar was negligible in most recipes, but were \>25% in a handful, while the median dietary fibre in grams/megajoule were 1.9 (IQR 1.1, 3.0). In regards to fiber, few recipes that had grains as an ingredient specified that whole grains should be used (not shown).

```

In terms of micronutrients, per 100g the recipes contributed most to percentage of RDI of vitamin B12 (median 26, IQR 10, 48), phosphorus (median 19, IQR 15, 23) and vitamin B6 (median 14, IQR 9, 20). On the other end, recipes contributed least to percentage of RDI of vitamin D (median 2, IQR 1, 7), iodine (median, 3 IQR 1, 5) and calcium (median 3, IQR 2, 7). Recipes contained more vitamin A in the form of retinol than beta-carotene. See **Figure** \@ref(fig:all-micros). For the micronutrients copper, iodine, selenium, sodium, phosphorus, vitamin A, D, E B2 (riboflavin), B9 (folate and B12 handful of recipes could deliver more than the RDI per 100 g.

### Between countries comparison

Of the total 35 nutrients, healthiness and environmental sustainability indicators assessed, 18 were significantly different (BH adjusted *p*-value \<0.05) between at least two countries in the Kruskal-Wallis test, so a *post-hoc* Dunn test was performed.

Recipes from the UK scored significantly better than recipes from Norway (BH adjusted *p*-value \<0.05) and the US (BH adjusted *p*-value \<0.001) on the NNR guidelines and the inverted Nutriscore (BH adjusted *p*-value \<0.05). Norway scored significantly better than the US recipes in the inverted multiple traffic light model (BH adjusted *p*-value \<0.05) and the NNR guidelines **Figure** \@ref(fig:violinbox-healthiness). To which components of the recipes that contributed to their final healthiness scores, see **Appendix Figure** \@ref(fig:raw-score-guidelines), **Appendix Figure** \@ref(fig:raw-score-nutriscore) and **Appendix Figure** \@ref(fig:raw-score-trafficlights) for the guidelines, Nutriscore and Multiple Traffic Light respectively.

Recipes from Norway caused significantly (BH adjusted *p*-value \<0.05) more CO~2~ emissions than recipes from the UK, while The US recipes had significantly higher CO~2~ emissions than recipes from both the UK (BH adjusted *p*-value \<0.001) and Norway (BH adjusted *p*-value \<0.05). The UK recipes also had significantly higher land requirements than both the Norwegian (BH adjusted *p*-value \<0.05) and the UK (BH adjusted *p*-value \<0.01) **Figure** \@ref(fig:violinbox-env-sustainability).

```{r violinbox-healthiness, fig.cap = "The healthiness of the recipes based on the dietary guidelines from the World Health Organization and Nordic Nutritional Recommendations, and the inverted Multiple Traffic Light model from the UK and the inverted Nutriscore from France.", out.width="60%"}
knitr::include_graphics("images/violinbox_health_numerical.png")
```

```{r violinbox-env-sustainability, fig.cap = "The environmental impact in kilo CO2 equivalents and m2 used per year per 100g of the recipes.", out.width = "60%"}
knitr::include_graphics("images/violinbox_env_impact.png")
```

In terms of individual nutrients, the UK recipes were significantly higher in dietary fibre and vitamin C than both the US and Norwegian recipes (BH adjusted *p*-value \<0.001 and \<0.01 respectively) and significantly lower than the US recipes in protein content (BH adjusted *p*-value \<0.05). While there were other statistically significantly different micronutrients, the actual difference between countries were negligible.

See **Appendix** **Table** \@ref(tab:stats-data) for the full details.

## Different food groups used in the recipes.

Meat products followed by seafood and vegetables (including roots and tubers) made up most of the weight of the recipes. Recipes from the UK tended to include less meat and more vegetables and fruits than recipes from Norway and the US (**Appendix Figure** \@ref(fig:percent-foodgroups-weight).

## Principal component analysis

The Norwegian recipe homemade stick-meat (pinnekjÃ¸tt) were left out of the PCA due to being a strong outlier in sodium content.

The PCA score plot (**Figure** \@ref(fig:PCA-data)A) showed no clustering of recipes from the different countries, in line with the small differences found in the dunn test. The loading plot (**Figure** \@ref(fig:PCA-data)B) showed that vitamin B12, vitamin A and retinol contributed the most to the first principal component, while kilocalories, vitamin E, fat and protein contributed the most to the second principal component.

```{r PCA-data, message=FALSE, out.width = "80%", fig.cap = "Principal component analysis score plot (A) and loadings plot (B)."}
knitr::include_graphics("images/pca_plots.png")
```

The angle between the loading vectors of vitamin B12, vitamin A and the sub-type of vitamin A retinol, suggests these nutrients are positively correlated. The three recipes that contributed most to PC1 all included liver as a main ingredient. The angle between the loading vectors of kilocalories, fat and protein, suggests a positive correlation between kilocalories in a recipe and its fat content, and a negative correlation between kilocalories and fat with protein content.

## Correlation analyses

### Healthiness indicators and environmental impact indicators

Results from the Spearman correlation showed a significant (BH adjusted *p*-value \<0.001) positive correlation between the four healthiness indicators. The two dietary guidelines were more strongly correlated to each other than with either the multiple traffic light model or the Nutriscore, and vice versa. The two sustainability indicators had a significantly strong positive correlation (BH adjusted *p*-value \<0.001).

All four healthiness indicators were significantly (BH adjusted p\<0.001) negatively correlated with the two environmental sustainability indicators, with the two dietary guidelines being more strongly correlated with both GHGE and landuse than the multiple traffic light model and Nutriscore were.

See **Figure** \@ref(fig:Correlation-healthVSsustainability).

```{r Correlation-healthVSsustainability, out.width = "100%", fig.cap = "Spearman's Rho between CO2 equivalents (kg), landuse (m2/year) and health indicators."}
knitr::include_graphics("images/healthVSsustainability.png")
```

### Environmental sustainability indicators and energy providing nutrients

There was a weak positive correlation between total energy content in kilocalories, fat, saturated fat, protein and environmental sustainability indicators when all recipes were pooled together (BH adjusted *p*-value \<0.01). This association did not reach statistical significance in all countries separately. There was a stronger correlation between saturated fat and environmental sustainability indicators than for total fat and environmental sustainability indicators.

Sugar was positively correlated with both environmental sustainability indicators in the pooled recipe data (BH adjusted *p*-value \<0.01). In both cases this was driven by recipes from the US, where sugar was used in many meat-based recipes as part of a condiment (not shown). There was a trend that sugar was positively correlated with GHGE but not landuse in the UK recipes.

Landuse had a weak negative correlation with carbohydrates (rho -0.42, BH adjusted *p*-value \<0.001) and dietary fibre (rho -0.31, BH adjusted *p*-value \<0.001). GHGE had a moderate negative correlation with carbohydrates (rho -0.47, BH adjusted *p*-value \<0.001) and a weak negative correlation with dietary fibre (rho -0.36, BH adjusted *p*-value \<0.001).

In line with the PCA results, energy content was negatively correlated with protein content, and positively correlated with fat and saturated fat.

See **Figure** \@ref(fig:Correlation-energyVSsustainability) for details.

knitr::include_graphics("images/energyVSsustainability.png")
```

### Environmental sustainability indicators and mineral content

Many minerals were correlated with the environmental sustainability indicators, but the strength and significance of the correlations varied between countries.

There was a weak negative correlation between copper and GHGE (rho -0.1, BH adjusted *p*-value \<0.05). GHGE were positively correlated with Iron (rho 0.38, BH adjusted *p*-value \<0.001), phosphorus (rho 0.19, BH adjusted *p*-value \<0.001) and zinc (rho 0.67, BH adjusted *p*-value \<0.001). For copper the correlation was driven by recipes from the US. With iron the correlation was weaker for recipes from the UK than recipes from the US and Norway.

Landuse had a weak negative correlation (rho -0.16, BH adjusted *p*-value \<0.001) with calcium, iodine (rho -0.3, BH adjusted *p*-value \<0.001) and copper (rho -0.16, BH adjusted *p*-value \<0.001). The negative correlation between calcium and landuse was very low and did not reach significance in the Norwegian recipes. As with GHGE, the correlation between landuse and copper was driven by recipes from the US. Zinc were moderately positively correlated with landuse, while iron and phosphorus were weakly positively correlated with landuse. As with the correlations with GHGE, the correlation between landuse and iron were weaker in the UK recipes.

See **Figure** \@ref(fig:Correlation-mineralsVSsustainability1) and Figure \@ref(fig:Correlation-mineralsVSsustainability2).

```

### Environmental sustainability indicators and vitamin content

As with minerals, there were many vitamins that correlated with the environmental sustainability indicators, to various degrees of strength and significance.

GHGE had a weak negative correlation with folate (rho -0.27, BH adjusted *p*-value \<0.001), thiamine (rho -0.1, BH adjusted *p*-value \<0.05) vitamin C (rho -0.22, BH adjusted *p*-value \<0.001) and beta-carotene (rho -0.15, BH adjusted *p*-value \<0.001). For thiamine, the correlation was only significant in the pooled data. In all countries, there was a weak positive correlation between GHGE and niacin (rho 0.26, BH adjusted *p*-value \<0.001), riboflavin (rho 0.36, BH adjusted *p*-value \<0.38), vitamin B6 (rho 0.1, BH adjusted *p*-value \<0.05) and vitamin B12 (rho 0.36, BH adjusted *p*-value \<0.001). For the individual countries, the correlation between GHGE and vitamin B6 only reached significance in the recipe data from the UK, but there was a trend of the correlation moving in the same direction in the recipes from the US, but not Norway.

Correlation between the different vitamins and landuse generally followed the same pattern, but there was also a weak negative correlation between landuse and vitamin D content (rho -0.25, BH adjusted *p*-value \<0.001).

See **Figure** \@ref(fig:Correlation-vitaminsVSsustainability1) and **Figure** \@ref(fig:Correlation-vitaminsVSsustainability2).
